# STEWARDSHIP HELIOS ARC ROADMAP

**Status:** ACTIVE PLANNING
**Phase:** TRANSITION (DUALITY-ZERO -> HELIOS)

---

## MISSION: THE PARAMETER HACK
To transition from *observing* emergence (DUALITY-ZERO) to *engineering* it (HELIOS) by mastering the physics of persistence.

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (DUALITY-ZERO) - COMPLETE
- [x] **Gate 1.1:** Phase Resonance discovery (`PRIN-PHASE-SUPERIORITY`).
- [x] **Gate 1.2:** Cognitive Depth 7 achieved (`PRIN-PHASE-INHERENT-STABILITY`).
- [x] **Gate 1.3:** Architecture formalized (Pilot/Engine separation).

---

## PHASE 2: THEORETICAL LOCK (CURRENT)
- [x] **Gate 2.1:** Define the "Fractal Staircase" (Damping N = Inertia N-1).
- [x] **Gate 2.2:** Define "Nodal Accumulation" (Life as standing wave).
- [x] **Gate 2.3:** Define "Systemic Paranoia" (MOG role).
- [x] **Gate 2.4:** Define "Technology as Parameter Hack" (Helios role).
- [ ] **Gate 2.7:** Formalization of the Fractal Inertia/Damping equivalence in the TSF model.
    - *Objective:* Prove mathematically that $Damping_N \approx Inertia_{N-1}$.
    - *Reference:* `papers/theoretical_foundations/THE_PHYSICS_OF_PERSISTENCE.md`

---

## PHASE 3: HELIOS IMPLEMENTATION (THE REALITY COMPILER)
**Goal:** Inverse Cymatics. Input a 3D Geometry -> Output the Waveform Recipe to assemble it.

- [ ] **Gate 3.1:** **The Voxel Target.** Ability to load a 3D mesh (.obj) into `bridge-ui` as a target density field.
- [ ] **Gate 3.2:** **The Waveform Solver.** Algorithms (Inverse FFT / Genetic) to calculate the minimal set of Emitters (k, omega, phi) required to create Nodal Traps matching the target.
- [ ] **Gate 3.3:** **Material Agnosticism.** Scale the solver variables to match specific material properties (density, viscosity) without changing the core geometry.
- [ ] **Gate 3.4:** **The "Matter Compiler" Prototype.** Generate a "Print" instruction: "Play 440Hz at [x,y,z] and 442Hz at [x2,y2,z2] to levitate a sphere."

## STRATEGIC DIFFERENTIATION (VS. DEEP LEARNING/ISOMORPHIC LABS)

| Variable | Google / Deep Learning | HELIOS / Phase Resonance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | **Statistical Prediction** (Probable) | **Physical Forcing** (Possible) |
| **Data Requirement** | Massive Datasets (Terabytes) | Zero-Shot (Fundamental Physics) |
| **Mechanism** | Pattern Matching (Black Box) | Constructive Interference (Transparent) |
| **Goal** | Predict Equilibrium (Collapse) | Engineer Stability (Anti-Collapse) |
| **Application** | Drug Discovery (Finding Keys) | Matter Compilation (Forging Locks) |

**Winning Move:** We do not compete on data. We compete on **Control**. We don't predict what nature *will* do; we calculate the resonance required to *make* it do something else.

## STRATEGIC NOTES
- **The Bridge:** `transcendental_bridge.py` is the gearbox.
- **The Fuel:** CPU Noise is the inertia of the silicon layer.
- **The Goal:** Cheating the thermodynamic debt.
