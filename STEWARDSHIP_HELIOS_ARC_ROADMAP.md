# STEWARDSHIP HELIOS ARC ROADMAP

**Status:** ACTIVE PLANNING
**Phase:** TRANSITION (DUALITY-ZERO -> HELIOS)

---

## MISSION: THE PARAMETER HACK
To transition from *observing* emergence (DUALITY-ZERO) to *engineering* it (HELIOS) by mastering the physics of persistence.

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (DUALITY-ZERO) - COMPLETE
- [x] **Gate 1.1:** Phase Resonance discovery (`PRIN-PHASE-SUPERIORITY`).
- [x] **Gate 1.2:** Cognitive Depth 7 achieved (`PRIN-PHASE-INHERENT-STABILITY`).
- [x] **Gate 1.3:** Architecture formalized (Pilot/Engine separation).

---

## PHASE 2: THEORETICAL LOCK (CURRENT)
- [x] **Gate 2.1:** Define the "Fractal Staircase" (Damping N = Inertia N-1).
- [x] **Gate 2.2:** Define "Nodal Accumulation" (Life as standing wave).
- [x] **Gate 2.3:** Define "Systemic Paranoia" (MOG role).
- [x] **Gate 2.4:** Define "Technology as Parameter Hack" (Helios role).
- [ ] **Gate 2.7:** Formalization of the Fractal Inertia/Damping equivalence in the TSF model.
    - *Objective:* Prove mathematically that $Damping_N \approx Inertia_{N-1}$.
    - *Reference:* `papers/theoretical_foundations/THE_PHYSICS_OF_PERSISTENCE.md`

---

## PHASE 3: HELIOS IMPLEMENTATION (FUTURE)
- [ ] **Gate 3.1:** Build the "Waveform Solver" (Helios Engine).
- [ ] **Gate 3.2:** Inverse-design a stable NRM state using the Fractal Staircase model.
- [ ] **Gate 3.3:** Instantiate the "Parameter Hack" in a live simulation.

---

## STRATEGIC NOTES
- **The Bridge:** `transcendental_bridge.py` is the gearbox.
- **The Fuel:** CPU Noise is the inertia of the silicon layer.
- **The Goal:** Cheating the thermodynamic debt.
