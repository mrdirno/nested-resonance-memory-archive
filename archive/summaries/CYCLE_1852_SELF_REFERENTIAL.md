# Cycle 1852: Self-Referential Property

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1852
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

**λ = N₁ = 14 is the natural system scale**

- Minimum viable N: 8
- First dead zone: N=14
- Wavelength: λ ≈ 14

The wavelength equals the first dead zone - this is the fundamental scale of NRM composition dynamics.

## Results

### Minimum Viable N

| N | Coex | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 8 | 60% | First viable |
| 9 | 100% | Safe |
| 14 | 40% | First major dead |
| 17-24 | 93-100% | All safe |

### B/C Ratio

At prob=0.10:
- B/C = 0.20 for all N
- Ratio depends on prob, not N

## Self-Referential Interpretation

### Why λ = N₁?

1. **N=14 is the critical threshold** where first resonance failure occurs
2. **14 is the natural scale** of composition-decomposition dynamics
3. **Subsequent dead zones** occur at multiples: 14, 28, 42, 56...

### System Definition

The NRM system defines its own scale:
- λ = wavelength = 14
- N₁ = first dead zone = 14
- They are the same by definition

This is not coincidence - it's the fundamental property that defines the system's rhythm.

## Conclusions

1. **Minimum viable: N=8**
2. **First dead zone: N=14**
3. **Self-referential: λ = N₁**
4. **Natural scale**: 14 agents per resonance cycle
