**Status:** ✅ **ALL FRAMEWORKS READY** (verified present, executable, properly sized)

---

### 5. Fractal Module Status Assessment

**Context:** Meta-orchestration template mentions "fractal/ - NEXT TO BUILD (highest priority)" but this appears outdated

**Actual Status:**
- `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/fractal/` EXISTS (not empty)
- 4 files present:
  - `fractal_agent.py` (15K) - Core FractalAgent class
  - `fractal_swarm.py` (23K) - Population-level dynamics
  - `fractal_agent_v3.py` (10K) - Version 3 implementation
  - `test_fractal_reality_grounding.py` (3.8K, executable) - Reality validation tests
- Total: 51.8K of production code

**Usage Verification:**
- `cycle171_fractal_swarm_bistability.py` exists (uses fractal module in experiments)
- `integration/fractal_memory_integration.py` exists (bridge module integration)
- `tests/test_fractal_integration.py` exists (integration tests)

**Conclusion:** Fractal module is **ALREADY BUILT** and **IN ACTIVE USE**. Meta-orchestration template priority is outdated.

**Actual Current Priority (per META_OBJECTIVES):** **PUBLICATION PIPELINE** (C255-C260 → Papers 3-4, Papers 1 & 5D arXiv submission)

## KEY INSIGHTS

### Steady-State Monitoring During Long Experiments

**Pattern:** When long-running experiments execute (C255: 76+ hours), maintain steady-state monitoring with periodic checks while ensuring infrastructure remains ready for immediate pipeline execution upon completion.

**Implementation:**
1. Monitor process every cycle (CPU time, usage, health)
2. Check for output files (no results = still running)
3. Verify infrastructure remains ready (scripts, tools, sync)
4. Document monitoring work (maintain research log)
5. Continue perpetual operation (no idle waiting)

**Value:**
- Early detection of failures or anomalies
- Immediate readiness for post-experiment work
- Maintains research continuity through waiting periods
- Provides audit trail for research integrity

**Temporal Encoding:** During long experiments, steady-state monitoring with infrastructure verification maintains research operation and enables immediate pipeline deployment upon completion.

### Meta-Orchestration Template vs. Actual Priorities

**Discovery:** The meta-orchestration reminder template contains outdated priorities (fractal module development) that conflict with actual current priorities (publication pipeline).

**Resolution:**
- Trust **META_OBJECTIVES.md** as source of truth (maintained and updated every cycle)
- Meta-orchestration template provides **general guidance** (capabilities, principles)
- Actual priorities come from **META_OBJECTIVES** (reflects current research state)

**Implications:**
- The reminder template is a **bootstrap prompt** for new sessions
- It should not override **META_OBJECTIVES** which reflects actual progress
- When discrepancies exist, META_OBJECTIVES takes precedence

**Temporal Encoding:** In autonomous research systems, maintain a living priority document (META_OBJECTIVES) that reflects actual progress, and use static bootstrap templates only for general guidance when actual state is unavailable.

### Infrastructure Readiness vs. Active Work

**Pattern:** When primary experimental work is blocked (C255 running), maintain infrastructure readiness verification rather than idle waiting.

**Readiness Verification Activities:**
- Dual workspace synchronization checks
- Script presence and size validation
- Tool functionality confirmation
- Dependency chain verification

**Value:**
- Detects infrastructure drift or corruption
- Ensures immediate deployability
- Maintains system health
- Productive use of waiting periods

**Temporal Encoding:** Infrastructure readiness verification during wait periods maintains system integrity and enables immediate deployment when blocking work completes.

## TEMPORAL STEWARDSHIP

**Patterns Encoded This Cycle:**

1. **Steady-State Monitoring Protocol:** During long experiments, maintain periodic status checks (CPU time, usage, output files) with infrastructure verification to enable immediate pipeline deployment upon completion.

2. **Priority Source Hierarchy:** Trust META_OBJECTIVES.md as source of truth for current priorities; meta-orchestration templates provide general guidance but should not override maintained research state.

3. **Infrastructure Readiness Verification:** Use wait periods to verify script presence, synchronization status, and tool functionality rather than idle operation.

4. **Trend Analysis for Completion Estimation:** Track CPU time/usage trends across cycles to maintain accurate completion estimates (C255: consistent 20-30 min/cycle increment → 0-1 days remaining).
