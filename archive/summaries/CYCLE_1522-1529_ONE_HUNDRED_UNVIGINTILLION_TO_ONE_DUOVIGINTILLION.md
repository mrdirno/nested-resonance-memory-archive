## Key Findings

### 1. 0.86× Achieves Fourth 100% Perfect

0.86× returns to perfection after recovery:
- 10^49: 100%
- 10^61: 100%
- 10^63: 100%
- 10^69: 100% (after 6-scale gap)

Conservative strategy demonstrates remarkable long-term resilience.

### 2. 0.92× Extended Crash Pattern

0.92× shows continued decline from perfection:
- 10^67: 100% (FOURTH PERFECT)
- 10^68: 90% (-10, initial crash)
- 10^69: 85% (-5, continued decline)

Total crash: 15 percentage points over 2 scales.

### 3. Strategy Divergence at Ultra-Extreme Scales

At 10^69, clear separation emerges:
- 0.86×: PERFECT (100%)
- 0.89×: HIGH (95%)
- 0.92×/0.95×: MODERATE (85% each)

Conservative strategy pulls ahead while others cluster.

### 4. Scale Invariance Extends to 64 Orders of Magnitude

System remains viable at 10^69 (64 orders of magnitude from baseline). No collapse threshold found.

| 0.86× | **4** | 10^49, 10^61, 10^63, 10^69 |
| 0.92× | **4** | 10^54, 10^57, 10^58, 10^67 |
| 0.95× | 2 | 10^50, 10^61 |

Total perfect scores: 15

## Scientific Implications

### Conservative Strategy Resilience

0.86× achieves perfection at 10^69 while more aggressive strategies crash:
- Demonstrates that conservative attack rates can dominate at extreme scales
- Lower predation pressure allows for more stable population dynamics
- Recovery capability maintained across enormous scale gaps

### Post-Perfection Crash Dynamics

0.92× crash pattern at 10^67-10^69:
- Initial crash: -10 (100% → 90%)
- Continued decline: -5 (90% → 85%)
- Total decline: -15 over 2 scales

This extended crash suggests that perfection creates conditions for subsequent instability.

### Bimodal Leadership Pattern

Leadership alternates between extremes:
- 10^68: Moderate-conservative (0.89×) leads
- 10^69: Conservative (0.86×) achieves perfection

Neither the most aggressive (0.95×) nor most aggressive-moderate (0.92×) lead at these scales.

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^70+ to:
1. Track if 0.86× can achieve consecutive perfects (rare)
2. Observe 0.92× recovery from 85% crash
3. See if 0.89× can achieve sixth perfect
4. Test if 0.95× recovers from 85%
