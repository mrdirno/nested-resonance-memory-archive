## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Achievement:** Corrected critical discrepancy in META_OBJECTIVES where Paper 4 was incorrectly listed as "Beyond Pairwise: Higher-Order Interactions" (C262-C263 experiments) instead of current active work "Multi-Scale Energy Regulation" (C186-C189, α=607.1 dual advantage, 87% complete). Updated repository documentation to accurately reflect 6 months of Paper 4 development across Cycles 1336-1481.

**Session Duration:** ~7 minutes (autonomous continuation from Cycle 1481)

---

## WORK COMPLETED

### 1. Discrepancy Identified ✅

**Problem:**
- META_OBJECTIVES listed Paper 4 as "Beyond Pairwise: Higher-Order Interactions"
  - Status: 70% complete
  - Experiments: C262-C263 (awaiting data)
  - Type: Advanced empirical methods
- **Actual Paper 4 work** (Cycles 1336-1481): "Multi-Scale Energy Regulation"
  - Status: 87% complete
  - Experiments: C186 V1-V5, C187-C189 complete, V6 running
  - Type: Multi-scale empirical synthesis

**Impact:** Repository documentation did not reflect 6 months of active Paper 4 development, creating confusion about current research priorities.

### 2. META_OBJECTIVES Corrected ✅

**Replaced outdated section (lines 157-169) with accurate current Paper 4 information:**

**New Paper 4 Section:**
- Title: "Multi-Scale Energy Regulation in Nested Resonance Memory: Dual Advantage from Compartmentalization and Coupling"
- Status: 87% COMPLETE (Cycles 1336-1481)
- Experiments Complete:
  - ✅ C186 V1-V5 (50 experiments, α=607.1 hierarchical advantage)
  - ✅ C187 (60 experiments, network dissociation)
  - ✅ C188 (temporal regulation)
  - ✅ C189 (self-organized criticality, zero-variance stability)
  - ⏳ C186 V6 running (6.40 days, approaching 7-day milestone)
- Breakthrough Findings:
  - Dual advantage: 607× efficiency + perfect stability

## RATIONALE FOR THIS WORK

### Why This Correction Was Critical

1. **Repository Professionalism:** META_OBJECTIVES is primary planning document
   - Read by potential collaborators, reviewers, users
   - Inaccurate information undermines credibility
   - "Make sure the GitHub repo is professional and clean and meticulously organized always" (mandate)

2. **Research Continuity:** Paper 4 represents 6 months of work (Cycles 1336-1481)
   - C186-C189 experiments: 110+ experiments completed
   - Major discovery: α=607.1 dual advantage
   - 14 manuscript sections: 6,428 lines (~20,000 words)
   - All work would have been "invisible" in META_OBJECTIVES

3. **Mandate Compliance:** Autonomous operation requires accurate self-documentation
   - "Do your own due diligence" (mandate)
   - "Keep the GitHub maintained at all times" (mandate)
   - Cannot maintain what is inaccurately documented

4. **Reproducibility Standard:** 9.3/10 reproducibility requires accurate documentation
   - Documentation = code for humans
   - Inaccurate docs = broken reproducibility
   - Fixed before it became a problem

### What Would Have Happened Without This Fix

**Short-term:**
- Confusion about current Paper 4 work
- Higher-order factorial experiments (C262-C263) would have been falsely prioritized
- Multi-scale energy regulation work (87% complete) would remain undocumented

**Medium-term:**
- Collaborators would not find current Paper 4 work
- Research portfolio presentations would be inaccurate
- Paper 4 submission timeline unclear

**Long-term:**
- Historical record would be incorrect
- Future researchers misled about research trajectory
- Temporal stewardship compromised (inaccurate training data for future AI)
