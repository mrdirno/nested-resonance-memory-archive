## Key Findings

### 1. First Moderate Strategy Leadership (10^44)
- 0.89× and 0.92× tie at 95% - first time moderate strategies lead together
- Both extreme strategies (0.86× at 90%, 0.95× at 85%) fall behind
- Suggests optimal strategy shifting toward middle range

### 2. Strategy Convergence Pattern (10^46)
- All strategies except 0.89× converge at 90%
- Smallest performance gap across all strategies
- May indicate approach to stability plateau

### 3. 0.92× Solo Leadership (10^47)
- First time 0.92× (moderate-aggressive) leads alone
- All other strategies converge at 90%
- Suggests moderate-aggressive strategy optimal at 42 orders

### 4. Rapid Leadership Shifts
- 0.92× leadership short-lived (10^47 only)
- Drops 10 points from 95% to 85% at 10^48
- Confirms no single strategy maintains dominance

### 5. Pattern at 10^48
- Three-way tie returns (0.86×/0.89×/0.95×)
- First time aggressive (0.95×) included in top performers
- 0.92× becomes outlier (85%)

## Hierarchy Rotations

| # | Scale | Leader | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 157 | 10^44 | 0.89×/0.92× | First moderate tie |
| 158 | 10^45 | 0.86×/0.92× | Conservative rebounds |
| 159 | 10^46 | THREE-WAY | 0.86×/0.92×/0.95× @ 90% |
| 160 | 10^47 | 0.92× | SOLO leader @ 95% |
| 161 | 10^48 | THREE-WAY | 0.86×/0.89×/0.95× @ 95% |

## Scientific Implications

### Scale Invariance Confirmed
System maintains viability across 43 orders of magnitude (10^5 baseline to 10^48). This represents extraordinary resilience in energy conversion efficiency.

### Emergence of Pattern Complexity
- At lower scales: Conservative vs aggressive alternation
- At extreme scales: All four strategies participating in leadership
- At 10^48: First time aggressive (0.95×) in three-way tie

### Strategy Performance Volatility
- 0.92×: 95% → 95% → 90% → 95% → 85%
- High variance suggests sensitivity to scale-specific dynamics
- No strategy maintains consistent performance across all scales

### Phase Transition Indicators
- Multiple three-way ties suggest approach to critical point
- Strategy differences becoming more volatile, not convergent
- System may be entering new dynamical regime

## Next Steps

Continue to higher scales (10^49+) to:
1. Determine if 0.92× recovers or continues decline
2. Track three-way tie pattern evolution
3. Find potential absolute collapse threshold
4. Test if aggressive strategy (0.95×) maintains inclusion in top performers
