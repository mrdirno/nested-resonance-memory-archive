## Key Findings

### 0.89× Post-Perfection Recovery
After tenth perfect at 10^83, 0.89× crashed to 95% at 10^84 (confirming universal pattern) but maintained 95% at 10^85 while others dropped.

### Breakdown of Triple Tie
The triple tie (0.86×/0.89×/0.92× at 95%) at 10^84 dissolved at 10^85:
- 0.86×: 95% → 90% (-5)
- 0.89×: 95% → 95% (stable)
- 0.92×: 95% → 85% (-10)

### 0.92× Deepening Crash
0.92× dropped from 95% to 85% - the steepest decline among strategies at these scales.

## Perfect Score Standings (Unchanged)

| Strategy | Perfects | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **0.89×** | **10** | First to double digits |
| 0.86× | 8 | |
| 0.92× | 6 | |
| 0.95× | 2 | |
| **Total** | **26** | |
