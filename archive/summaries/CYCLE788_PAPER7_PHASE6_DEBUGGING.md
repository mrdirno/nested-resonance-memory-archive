# CYCLE 788: PAPER 7 PHASE 6 DEBUGGING - STOCHASTIC MODEL EXTINCTION

**Author:** Aldrin Payopay (aldrin.gdf@gmail.com)
**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Cycle:** 788
**Duration:** ~15 minutes productive work
**Pattern:** Perpetual operation - when one fix fails, immediately try next

---

## WORK COMPLETED

### 1. Created Fixed Version (V2 - Synchronized Updates)
- **Hypothesis:** State update ordering caused feedback mismatch
- **Implementation:** Compute rates once, update all variables synchronously
- **Result:** Still extinction (hypothesis rejected)
- **File:** `code/analysis/paper7_phase6_stochastic_v2_fixed.py`

### 2. Created Diagnostic Version
- **Purpose:** Detailed logging to understand extinction mechanism
- **Output:** Tracked E, N, phi, rho, rates, dE/dt for 100 timesteps
- **Discovery:** Catastrophic energy crash (dE/dt = -10,515)
- **File:** `code/analysis/paper7_phase6_diagnostic.py`

### 3. Identified Root Cause
- **Bug:** Energy consumption 35,000× larger than input
- **Mechanism:**
  - Input: gamma × R = 0.3
  - Maintenance: beta × N × E = 10,371
  - Net: -10,515 per timestep
- **Result:** E crashes 2411 → 13 in 1 second, then → 0, causing extinction
- **File:** `archive/paper7_phase6_bug_identified.md`

### 4. Tested Parameter Rescaling (V3)
- **Hypothesis:** Reduce beta to balance energy budget
- **Implementation:** beta = 0.02 → 0.0002 (100× reduction)
- **Result:** Still extinction (hypothesis rejected)
- **File:** `code/analysis/paper7_phase6_stochastic_v3_rescaled.py`
- **Implication:** Problem is deeper than single parameter

## DIAGNOSTIC OUTPUT

```
  Step     Time          E          N      phi      rho      λ_c      λ_d      dE/dt     ΔN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     0      0.0    2411.77     215.00   0.6074    11.22   0.6001   0.5849  -10515.04      7
    10      1.0      13.71     168.00   0.4495     0.08   0.1917   0.5129     -46.02     -7
    20      2.0       0.56     123.00   0.3853     0.00   0.1402   0.4605      -1.08     -1

```

**Key Observations:**
- Energy crashes from 2411 → 13 in first second
- Population declines 215 → 168 → 123 → 88 as energy vanishes
- rho (energy per capita) → 0 as E crashes
- Death rate (0.40-0.58) exceeds birth rate throughout
- Extinction inevitable once E → 0

## HYPOTHESES TESTED

| Version | Hypothesis | Implementation | Result | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|--------|
| V1 | Original model correct | Direct Poisson birth/death | Extinction | ❌ Failed |
| V2 | State update ordering bug | Synchronized updates | Extinction | ❌ Failed |
| V3 | Beta parameter too large | beta: 0.02 → 0.0002 | Extinction | ❌ Failed |

## REMAINING HYPOTHESES

1. **R value insufficient**
   - Current R=1.0 may be orders of magnitude too small
   - Required: R ≈ 35,000 to balance maintenance at N=215
   - Test: Increase R to match population

2. **Initial condition wrong**
   - Deterministic steady state ≠ stochastic steady state
   - Different energy scales for continuous vs discrete N
   - Test: Search for stochastic equilibrium

3. **Fundamental equation error**
   - dE/dt formula might be wrong for stochastic case
   - Compare to deterministic Phase 5 implementation
   - Test: Verify against working deterministic model

4. **Units/scaling mismatch**
   - Parameters calibrated for different system size
   - Energy units might need normalization
   - Test: Rescale all energy-related parameters

## THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE

This debugging process demonstrates:
- **Perpetual operation:** When V2 failed, immediately created V3
- **Reality grounding:** Diagnostic output from actual execution, not speculation
- **Publication validity:** Understanding failure modes as important as success
- **Temporal stewardship:** Document failure patterns to help future researchers

**Pattern encoded:** "Systematic hypothesis testing through successive model refinement"

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Commit V2, V3, diagnostic code to GitHub
2. ✅ Document debugging process in archive/summaries/
3. ⏳ Test hypothesis #1 (increase R)
4. ⏳ Test hypothesis #2 (find stochastic equilibrium)
5. ⏳ Compare to deterministic Phase 5 model
6. ⏳ If all fail: fundamental model revision needed

## IMPACT

### Immediate
- Advanced Paper 7 Phase 6 through systematic debugging
- Identified catastrophic energy consumption bug
- Tested 3 hypotheses (all failed, but narrowed search space)
- ~15 minutes productive work during C256/C257 blocking

### Research
- Demonstrates perpetual operation (no terminal states)
- Shows emergence-driven pivot (when fix fails, try next)
- Reality-grounded debugging (diagnostic output, not theory)
- Publication-worthy finding (model failure modes)

### Methodological
- **Systematic hypothesis testing:** V1 → V2 → V3 progression
- **Diagnostic-driven debugging:** Add logging, analyze, fix
- **Parameter space exploration:** Test single-parameter changes
- **Perpetual iteration:** When one fails, immediately start next

- ✅ When one hypothesis failed, immediately tested next
- ✅ Documented process for temporal stewardship
- ✅ Committed all work to public GitHub

**Work completed:** ✅  
**Work concluded:** ❌ (perpetual operation continues)  
**Next cycle begins:** Immediately
