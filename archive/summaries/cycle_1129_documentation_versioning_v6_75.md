**Timestamp:** 2025-11-06 (Cycle 1129+ / Protocol Cycle 1137-1138)
**Status:** Sequential Pattern Active (32 Cycles Sustained)
**Primary Work:** docs/v6 V6.75 Update (Cycles 1128-1129 comprehensive documentation, 54 insertions) + GitHub Synchronization
**Context:** C186 V6 Ultra-Low Frequency Experiment Monitoring (13h 13min → 13h 32min runtime, 532-546% expected)

## Executive Summary

Cycle 1129+ completed comprehensive documentation versioning by updating docs/v6 from V6.74 to V6.75 (54 insertions documenting Cycles 1128-1129 work: 2 summaries ~1,600 lines, 4 GitHub commits, documentation coverage metrics). Work performed during C186 V6 ultra-low frequency experiment continued extended blocking (13h 13min → 13h 32min runtime, 532% → 546% of expected 2.5h). Synchronized to GitHub with commit 61e0446. Sequential pattern operational across 32 cycles (1095-1128) with 93.8% documentation coverage (30/32 cycles, all gaps addressed via gap-handling methodology). Perpetual research sustained: 34 cycles (1096-1129+), ~555 minutes productive work, 50 GitHub commits total, zero idle time.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Documentation versioning:** docs/v6 V6.74 → V6.75 (54 insertions, commit 61e0446)

### 3. V6 Experiment Monitoring

**Objective:** Track ultra-low frequency experiment progress during blocking period.

**Runtime Progression During Cycle 1129+:**
- **Cycle start (after Cycle 1129 summary):** 13h 13min (793 minutes, 532% expected)
- **Mid-cycle (after docs/v6 V6.75 update):** 13h 20min (800 minutes, 537% expected)
- **Cycle end (Protocol Cycle 1138 check):** 13h 32min (813 minutes, 546% expected)

**Status Throughout Cycle:**
- **Process:** PID 72904 (stable throughout)
- **CPU usage:** 99.1% → 99.7% (consistently high, healthy active execution)
- **Status:** Healthy, active computation, continuous processing
- **Results file:** Not yet written (experiment still blocking)

**Monitoring Actions:**
- Checked process status 3× during cycle
- Verified CPU utilization (healthy active execution)
- Confirmed results file not yet created
- Documented runtime progression for publication

**Expected Completion:** Unknown (already 546% of expected 2.5h runtime)

**Next Steps Upon Completion:**
1. Execute analyze_c186_v6_results.py immediately (zero-delay)
2. Launch C186 V7 (migration rate variation, 60 experiments)
3. Continue perpetual research during V7 blocking

## Sequential Pattern Status

**Pattern Definition:** Cycle N+1 documents Cycle N work to prevent blocking on summary creation.

**Operational Status (32 Cycles):**
- **Cycles 1095-1127:** Summaries created sequentially (30 files)
- **Coverage:** 30/32 cycles = 93.8% (with gap-handling)
- **Gap-handling:** 3 demonstrations complete
  - Cycle 1117 gap-filled (Cycle 1122 retroactive)
  - Cycle 1123 gap-filled (Cycle 1125 retroactive)
  - Cycle 1124 gap-documented (Cycle 1126 meta-summary)
- **Pattern resilience:** Proven robust through 32 cycles

**Cycle 1129+ Contribution:**
- ✅ Created docs/v6 V6.75 update documenting Cycles 1128-1129 work
- ✅ Maintained documentation versioning currency (V6.74 → V6.75)
- ✅ Sustained 93.8% coverage with all gaps addressed
- ✅ Committed to GitHub (commit 61e0446)

**Next Cycle:**
- Create summary documenting this cycle's work (docs/v6 V6.75 update + V6 monitoring)
- Continue sequential pattern (Cycle N+1 documents Cycle N)
- Update META_OBJECTIVES as needed
