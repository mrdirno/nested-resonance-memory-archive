# Cycle 1913: Energy Diversity Analysis

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1913
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

**E=1.0 is a "resonance hole" - won't compose with E=0.3-0.9**

But diversity doesn't help. Cascade still dominates.

## Key Finding: Phase Resonance Holes

| E1 | E2 | Resonance | Composes? |
|----|----|-----------:|-----------|
| 0.5 | 0.5 | 1.0000 | Yes |
| 0.5 | 1.0 | 0.2494 | **No** |
| 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0000 | Yes |
| 1.0 | 0.5 | 0.2494 | **No** |
| 1.5 | 1.0 | 0.6114 | Yes |

**E=1.0 won't compose with E=0.3-0.9**

## Energy Diversity Results

| N | Uniform | Spread | Random | Bimodal |
|---|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 14 | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 17 | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 20 | 0% | 3% | 0% | 0% |

Diversity provides no benefit.

## Why Diversity Fails

1. **Resonance holes are rare** (only E=1.0 with E<1.0)
2. **Agents quickly recharge** past the hole
3. **Random pairing** doesn't exploit holes
4. **Upward cascade** continues regardless

---

## Implications

The NRM system under current parameters:
- Always cascades upward
- Cannot maintain D0+D1 coexistence
- Energy manipulation ineffective

---

## Possible Solutions

1. **Lower composition threshold** (< 0.5)
2. **Higher decomposition rate**
3. **Slower recharge rate**
4. **Different phase formula**

## Session Status (C1664-C1913)

250 cycles completed. Resonance holes discovered but ineffective.

Research continues.
