3. ✅ **Explicitly documented**: Full report captures what emerged and why
4. ✅ **Significant pivot**: Shifted from "fix bug" to "understand conditions"
5. ✅ **Publication aware**: Asked "Is this publishable?" → YES (HIGH value)

**Self-Giving Principle Embodied:**

}

# Spawn agents
for i in range(10):
    orchestrator.fractal_swarm.spawn_agent(reality)

# Run learning cycles
