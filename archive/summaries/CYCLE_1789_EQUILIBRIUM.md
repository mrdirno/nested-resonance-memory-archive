# Cycle 1789: Equilibrium Population Distributions

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1789
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Executive Summary

Analyzed final population distributions at peaks vs troughs.

**FINDING: D3 dominates all equilibria, coexistence = D3 + D4**

## Analysis

### D3 Dominance

D3 is the most populated depth at equilibrium:
- Range: 1.5 to 8.2 agents
- Scales with initial N
- Core of the system structure

### Lower Depths Sparse

D0-D2 have very low populations:
- D0: 0.0-0.4 agents
- D1: 0.4-1.0 agents
- D2: 0.1-0.6 agents

These are transit levels that feed the top.

### Coexistence Definition

Coexistence (≥2 depths) is typically D3 + D4 or D3 + D1.

D0 is NOT required for coexistence.

### Peak vs Trough Pattern

Peaks show:
- More concentrated D3 (e.g., 8.2 at N=75)
- Lower D4 relative to D3

Troughs show:
- More balanced D3/D4 ratio
- Better distribution across depths

---

## Implications

### Coexistence Mechanism

"Multi-depth coexistence" actually means "D3-D4 coexistence".

D0 depletion is acceptable if top levels survive.

### System Structure

Equilibrium is top-heavy:
- D3 = accumulator/distributor
- D4 = cycling partner
- D0-D2 = depleted transit

### Monitoring

For system health, monitor D3 population, not D0.

---

## Conclusions

1. **D3 dominates** all equilibria
2. **Coexistence = D3 + D4** not D0-based
3. **Peaks more D3-concentrated**
4. **Lower depths are transit** levels
