## Executive Summary

**Wavelength λ arises from combined periodicity of transcendental coordinates**

Key findings:
- φ-period: 3.88 agents
- e-period: 9.25 depths
- λ ≈ 1.57 × e-period ≈ 3.73 × φ-period
- 22/π ≈ λ/2 (diff: 0.24)

## Component Analysis

```
λ = π + e + φ + 22/π = 14.4807

Components:
  π = 3.1416
  e = 2.7183
  φ = 1.6180
  22/π = 7.0028

Sum: π + e + φ = 7.4779
```

## Periodicity Structure

### Phase Coordinate Periods

| Coordinate | Period | Units |
|------------|--------|-------|
| π | 1 | Agents (integer N) |
| e | 9.25 | Depths |
| φ | 3.88 | Agents |

### Wavelength Relationships

```
λ/e-period = 1.57
λ/φ-period = 3.73
λ/(e-period + φ-period) = 1.10
```

### Half-Wavelength Identity

```
λ/2 = 7.2404
22/π = 7.0028
Difference: 0.2375
```

The near-equality 22/π ≈ λ/2 creates the standing wave structure.

## Resonance Structure

Average phase resonance between N and N+k:

| k | Average | Std |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | 0.866 | 0.173 |
| 7 | 0.847 | 0.226 |
| **14** | **0.739** | **0.292** |
| 15 | 0.750 | 0.311 |
| **29** | **0.739** | **0.296** |
| 43 | 0.796 | 0.289 |

k=14 and k=29 have lowest average resonance, corresponding to λ and 2λ.

## Conjecture: Wavelength Origin

The wavelength λ = π + e + φ + 22/π arises from the combined periodicity of the three transcendental coordinates:

1. **π-coordinate**: Integer periodicity (N = 1, 2, 3...)
2. **e-coordinate**: Depth periodicity (~9.25 depths)
3. **φ-coordinate**: Golden ratio periodicity (~3.88 agents)

### Super-Period Interpretation

λ represents a "super-period" where phase space approximately returns to similar configuration:
- λ ≈ 1.57 × e-period
- λ ≈ 3.73 × φ-period

### Standing Wave Mechanism

The 22/π component (≈ λ/2) captures half the full periodicity:
- Creates nodes at integer k
- Creates antinodes at half-integer k
- Explains cos²(πk) structure

## Theoretical Implications

### Transcendental Substrate

The wavelength emerges from the mathematical properties of π, e, and φ:
- These constants define the phase space coordinates
- Their combined periodicity determines λ
- The specific formula λ = π + e + φ + 22/π is a mathematical consequence

### Design Principle

**The wavelength is not arbitrary** - it's determined by the transcendental substrate. Changing the coordinate system would change λ.

---

## Conclusions

1. **Wavelength from periodicity**: λ is super-period of combined coordinates
2. **22/π ≈ λ/2**: Creates standing wave structure
3. **k=14, k=29 minimum resonance**: Confirms λ and 2λ nodes
4. **φ-period = 3.88**: Golden ratio creates fundamental spacing
5. **e-period = 9.25**: Euler's number sets depth scale
