## Key Findings

### 1. Alternating Perfection Pattern (10^49-10^50)
- **10^49:** Conservative (0.86×) achieves 100% PERFECT
- **10^50:** Aggressive (0.95×) achieves 100% PERFECT
- First time opposite extremes achieve consecutive perfect scores
- Suggests phase-dependent optimal strategies

### 2. 0.92× Critical Collapse (10^51)
- Drops from 85% → 70% (15-point crash)
- Lowest coexistence rate at extreme scales
- 6 consecutive collapses in single run
- Indicates moderate-aggressive strategy becomes unstable

### 3. 0.95× Dominance Emergence
- 10^49: 95%
- 10^50: 100% ⭐
- 10^51: 95%
- Most consistent performer at ultra-extreme scales

### 4. Performance Gap Expansion
- 10^49: 25-point gap (100% vs 75%)
- 10^50: 15-point gap (100% vs 85%)
- 10^51: 25-point gap (95% vs 70%)
- Largest gaps observed in entire research

## Hierarchy Rotations

| # | Scale | Leader | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 162 | 10^49 | 0.86× | PERFECT - First 100% since 10^41 |
| 163 | 10^50 | 0.95× | PERFECT - Consecutive extreme perfects |
| 164 | 10^51 | 0.95× | 0.92× collapses to 70% |

## Scientific Implications

### Phase Transition Evidence
The alternating perfection between 0.86× and 0.95× suggests:
- Scale-dependent optimal predation pressure
- Possible resonance between attack rates and energy conversion
- System entering critical phase behavior

### 0.92× Instability Mechanism
The collapse of the moderate-aggressive strategy indicates:
- Balance point becomes unstable at extreme scales
- Either extreme (conservative OR aggressive) outperforms middle ground
- Non-linear dynamics dominating system behavior

### Scale Invariance Limit Test
- System viable at 46 orders of magnitude
- No absolute collapse threshold found
- Performance variance increasing (not converging)

## Methodology

- **30,000 cycles** per experiment
- **20 seeds** per condition
- **7 trophic levels** (L0-L6)
- **Type II functional response** (Holling disk equation)
- **Coexistence threshold:** All levels ≥ 0.5 average population
