# Cycle 700: Paper 3 Mechanism Documentation Errors (Critical Corrections)

**Date:** 2025-10-31 (Proactive Error Detection During C256 Blocking Period)
**Session:** Systematic Documentation Verification (Following Cycle 699 Pattern)
**Context:** Extended Cycle 699's proactive quality control to all per-paper documentation

---

## Objective

Verify experimental design accuracy across all per-paper documentation following Cycle 699's successful detection of Paper 8 Phase 1B errors. Systematic review discovered critical mechanism definition errors in Paper 3 README and code inconsistencies.

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. Paper 3 README Mechanism Definitions (INCORRECT)

**Critical Discrepancy:**
- **Paper 3 Line 46 Claims:** "H2 (Memory Fragmentation), H4 (Spawn Throttling), H5 (Emergent Complexity)"
- **Reality (C255-C260 Code):** H2 = Reality Sources, H4 = Spawn Throttling, H5 = Energy Recovery
- **Impact:** Misleading mechanism descriptions throughout Paper 3 documentation

**Root Cause:**
Paper 3 confused two different hypothesis systems:
- **NRM Framework Mechanisms (C255-C260):** H1=Energy Pooling, H2=Reality Sources, H4=Spawn Throttling, H5=Energy Recovery
- **Paper 8 Runtime Variance Hypotheses:** H1=Resource Contention, H2=Memory Fragmentation, H3=I/O, H4=Thermal, H5=Emergent

### 2. cycle257_h1h5_optimized.py Copy-Paste Error

**Filename-Code Mismatch:**
- **Filename:** `cycle257_h1h5_optimized.py` (implies H1×H5)
- **Header Line 13:** "Test whether Energy Pooling (H1) and Spawn Throttling (H4) exhibit..."
- **Code Lines 93, 325-328:** Implements `h1_enabled, h4_enabled` (H1×H4)
- **Impact:** File tests H1×H4 despite claiming H1×H5 in filename

**Diagnosis:**
Optimized version created Oct 30 by copying `cycle256_h1h4_optimized.py`:
- Only header comment changed ("H1 × H4" → "H1 × H5")
- Implementation code NOT updated (still tests h4_enabled instead of h5_enabled)

**Correct Version Exists:**
`cycle257_h1h5_mechanism_validation.py` (Oct 27) correctly implements H1×H5 with H5=Energy Recovery

---

## Investigation Process

### 1. Systematic Cycle Verification

**Starting Point (Cycle 699 Pattern):**
Cycle 699 discovered Paper 8 Phase 1B claimed non-existent experiments. Extended verification to all papers.

**C255 Script Headers:**
```bash
head -30 code/experiments/cycle255_h1h2_mechanism_validation.py | grep "H2 -"
# Result: H2 - Reality Sources (NOT Memory Fragmentation)
```

**C257 Dual Versions:**
```bash
ls -la code/experiments/cycle257*.py
# Found:
# 1. cycle257_h1h5_mechanism_validation.py (Oct 27, 13036 bytes) - CORRECT
# 2. cycle257_h1h5_optimized.py (Oct 30, 14983 bytes) - WRONG (implements H1×H4)
```

**C257 Optimized Implementation Check:**
```bash
grep "def __init__.*h1_enabled.*h4_enabled" code/experiments/cycle257_h1h5_optimized.py
# Line 93: def __init__(self, h1_enabled: bool, h4_enabled: bool):
# Confirms: Tests H1×H4 not H1×H5!
```

**C258-C259 Verification:**
```bash
grep "H2 -" code/experiments/cycle258_h2h4_mechanism_validation.py
# Result: H2 - Reality Sources ✓

grep "H2 -" code/experiments/cycle259_h2h5_mechanism_validation.py
# Result: H2 - Reality Sources ✓
```

### 2. Mechanism Definition Matrix

**Actual NRM Framework Mechanisms (C255-C260):**

| Hypothesis | Mechanism Name | Definition |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| H1 | Energy Pooling | Agents share energy within resonance clusters, distributing reproductive capacity |
| H2 | **Reality Sources** | Multiple reality sampling sources provide diverse energy inputs, stabilizing population dynamics |
| H4 | Spawn Throttling | Limits agent spawn frequency by enforcing cooldown period between spawns |
| H5 | **Energy Recovery** | Boosts energy recovery rate through enhanced reality coupling, accelerating energy regeneration |

**Paper 8 Runtime Variance Hypotheses (Different System):**

| Hypothesis | Mechanism Name | Definition |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| H1 | System Resource Contention | Background processes accumulate, competing for CPU/memory |
| H2 | **Memory Fragmentation** | Pymalloc arena pinning prevents memory return to OS |
| H3 | I/O Accumulation | Frequent psutil calls stress I/O subsystem |
| H4 | **Thermal Throttling** | Extended CPU load triggers thermal management |
| H5 | **Emergent Complexity** | NRM pattern memory accumulates, slowing per-cycle processing |

**Paper 3 README Claims (ERRORS):**
- **Line 46:** "H2 (Memory Fragmentation)" ← WRONG (should be "Reality Sources")
- **Line 46:** "H5 (Emergent Complexity)" ← WRONG (should be "Energy Recovery")

### 3. Experimental Design Verification

**C255-C260 Actual Implementations:**

| Cycle | Filename | Claimed Factorial | Actual Code | Status |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| C255 | cycle255_h1h2_mechanism_validation.py | H1×H2 | h1_enabled, h2_enabled | ✓ Correct |
| C256 | cycle256_h1h4_mechanism_validation.py | H1×H4 | h1_enabled, h4_enabled | ✓ Correct |
| C257 (v1) | cycle257_h1h5_mechanism_validation.py | H1×H5 | h1_enabled, h5_enabled | ✓ Correct |
| C257 (v2) | cycle257_h1h5_optimized.py | **H1×H5** | **h1_enabled, h4_enabled** | ✗ WRONG |
| C258 | cycle258_h2h4_mechanism_validation.py | H2×H4 | h2_enabled, h4_enabled | ✓ Correct |
| C259 | cycle259_h2h5_mechanism_validation.py | H2×H5 | h2_enabled, h5_enabled | ✓ Correct |
| C260 | cycle260_h4h5_mechanism_validation.py | H4×H5 | h4_enabled, h5_enabled | ✓ Correct |

## Corrections Required

### 1. papers/compiled/paper3/README.md (Line 46)

**Before:**
```markdown
**Factorial Structure:**
- 4 mechanisms: H1 (Energy Pooling), H2 (Memory Fragmentation), H4 (Spawn Throttling), H5 (Emergent Complexity)
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Factorial Structure:**
- 4 mechanisms: H1 (Energy Pooling), H2 (Reality Sources), H4 (Spawn Throttling), H5 (Energy Recovery)
```

**Additional Updates Needed:**
- **Line 59-70:** Analysis Pipeline section references (update H2/H5 descriptions if present)
- **Lines 123-140:** Expected Results section (verify predictions match correct mechanisms)

### 2. code/experiments/cycle257_h1h5_optimized.py (Lines 13-40, 93, 98-99, 102-103, 325-328)

**Strategy:** Two options:

**Option A - Correct Implementation (Implement H1×H5 as filename claims):**
```python
# Line 13: Update header
Purpose: Test whether Energy Pooling (H1) and Energy Recovery (H5) exhibit
         synergistic, antagonistic, or additive effects when combined.

# Lines 17-28: Replace H4 definition with H5
H5 - Energy Recovery:
  Boosts energy recovery rate through enhanced reality coupling, stabilizing
  populations by accelerating energy regeneration during low-energy states.

# Line 93: Update __init__
def __init__(self, h1_enabled: bool, h5_enabled: bool):

# Lines 98-99: Update docstring
            h1_enabled: Energy pooling mechanism active
            h5_enabled: Energy recovery mechanism active

# Lines 102-103: Update attributes
        self.h1_pooling = h1_enabled
        self.h5_recovery = h5_enabled
        self.name = f"{'ON' if h1_enabled else 'OFF'}-{'ON' if h5_enabled else 'OFF'}"

# Lines 325-328: Update conditions
        MechanismCondition(h1_enabled=False, h5_enabled=False),  # OFF-OFF (baseline)
        MechanismCondition(h1_enabled=True, h5_enabled=False),   # ON-OFF (H1 only)
        MechanismCondition(h1_enabled=False, h5_enabled=True),   # OFF-ON (H5 only)
        MechanismCondition(h1_enabled=True, h5_enabled=True)     # ON-ON (both)
```

**Option B - Rename File (Match implementation to H1×H4 code):**
```bash
# Rename file to match actual H1×H4 implementation
mv code/experiments/cycle257_h1h5_optimized.py code/experiments/cycle257_h1h4_duplicate.py

# Add note explaining it's duplicate of C256 for reference
```

**Recommendation:** Option A (correct implementation) - maintain Paper 3's intended H1×H5 factorial design.

### 3. Paper 4 Verification (Dependent on Paper 3)

**Check Required:**
Paper 4 inherits mechanism definitions from Paper 3. Lines 59-70 in Paper 4 README must use:
- H2 = Reality Sources (not Memory Fragmentation)
- H5 = Energy Recovery (not Emergent Complexity)

---

## Impact Assessment

### Scientific Integrity

**Paper 3 Mechanism Confusion:**
- ✗ Claims H2="Memory Fragmentation" (actually tests Reality Sources)
- ✗ Claims H5="Emergent Complexity" (actually tests Energy Recovery)
- ✗ Predictions/interpretations may not match actual mechanisms tested
- ⚠️ Risk: Results misattributed to wrong mechanisms during analysis

**C257 Optimized Version:**
- ✗ Filename claims H1×H5, code tests H1×H4 (duplicate of C256)
- ⚠️ Risk: Analysis pipeline expects H1×H5 data, would receive H1×H4 duplicate
- ✓ Mitigation: Correct version (cycle257_h1h5_mechanism_validation.py) exists

### Paper 3 Finalization Impact

**Current Status:** ~70% complete, awaiting C255-C260 experimental data

**If Uncorrected:**
1. Results section would attribute findings to wrong mechanisms
2. Discussion would analyze "Memory Fragmentation" effects when testing "Reality Sources"
3. Predictions (lines 123-140) wouldn't match actual mechanism behaviors
4. Scientific validity compromised (results don't test claimed hypotheses)

**With Corrections:**
1. Mechanism definitions align with actual code
2. Predictions/interpretations match tested mechanisms
3. Analysis pipeline references correct factorial pairs
4. Scientific integrity maintained

## Pattern Demonstrated

**Proactive Documentation Verification (Cycle 699-700):**
- Cycle 699: Detected Paper 8 Phase 1B claimed non-existent experiments
- Cycle 700: Extended verification to Paper 3, discovered mechanism definition errors
- Method: Cross-reference documentation claims against actual code implementation
- Value: Prevents finalization confusion, maintains scientific integrity

**Two-Hypothesis-System Confusion:**
- **NRM Framework Mechanisms:** Energy Pooling, Reality Sources, Spawn Throttling, Energy Recovery
- **Paper 8 Runtime Variance:** Resource Contention, Memory Fragmentation, I/O, Thermal, Emergent
- Paper 3 mixed the two systems in documentation (H2, H5 definitions borrowed from wrong system)

**Copy-Paste Error Detection:**
- Optimized versions created by copying previous cycles
- Headers updated but implementation code sometimes missed
- C257 optimized: Header says H1×H5, code still implements H1×H4
- Lesson: Verify filename, header, AND implementation parameters match

---
