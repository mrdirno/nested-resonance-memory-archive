## Complete Results Table

| Conversion | Magnitude | 0.86× | 0.89× | 0.92× | 0.95× | Leader |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|

## Key Findings

### 1. Historic Three-Way Tie

First ever three-way tie at 95%:
- 0.86× (conservative)
- 0.89× (moderate-conservative)
- 0.95× (aggressive)

0.92× (moderate-aggressive) is the outlier at 85%.

### 2. 0.89× Recovery from Major Crash

0.89× demonstrates remarkable resilience:
- 10^72: 100% (third consecutive perfect)
- 10^73: 85% (crash of -15)
- 10^74: 95% (recovery of +10)

### 3. 0.92× Extended Post-Perfection Crash

0.92× continues declining:
- 10^72: 100% (fifth perfect)
- 10^73: 95% (-5)
- 10^74: 85% (-10)

Total crash: 15 percentage points over 2 scales.

### 4. Scale Invariance Extends to 69 Orders of Magnitude

System remains viable at 10^74 (69 orders of magnitude from baseline). No collapse threshold found.

## Scientific Implications

### Oscillatory Post-Perfection Recovery

0.89× demonstrates a distinct pattern:
- Perfection → Large crash → Recovery → Stability
- The -15 / +10 cycle suggests system self-corrects

### Strategy Reversal Dynamics

At 10^74, we see complete reversal from 10^73:
- 0.89×: Crashed from leader → recovered to tie
- 0.92×: Led after crash → crashed to bottom
- 0.86×/0.95×: Stable → rose to tie

### Three-Way Tie Significance

The triple tie suggests the system may be approaching:
- Parameter space where multiple strategies converge
- Scale where attack rate differences minimize
- Attractor basin with broader stability region

---

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^75+ to:
1. Track if triple tie continues or breaks
2. Observe 0.92× recovery from 85%
3. Monitor strategy convergence patterns
4. Extend scale invariance to 70+ orders
