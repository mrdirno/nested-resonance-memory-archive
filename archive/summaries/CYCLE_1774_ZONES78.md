## All Verified Zones

| Zone | k | Prediction | Peak | Error |
|------|---|------------|------|-------|
| 1 | 0 | 29 | 29 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 43.5 | 44 | 0.5 |
| 3 | 2 | 58 | 58 | 0 |
| 4 | 3 | 72.5 | 75 | 2.5 |
| 5 | 4 | 87 | 89 | 2 |
| 6 | 5 | 101.5 | 101 | 0.5 |
| 7 | 6 | 116 | 118 | 2 |
| 8 | 7 | 130.5 | 133 | 2.5 |

**Mean error: 1.3**

## Observations

### Pattern Continues

The pairing peak pattern holds through Zone 8 (N=133).

### Peak Heights

Zone 8 peak (89.7%) is similar to Zone 1 (91.7%), suggesting pattern doesn't attenuate in peak height, just in coexistence effect.

---

## Conclusions

1. **Eight zones verified** via pairing peaks
2. **Mean error 1.3** N units
3. **Pattern continues** to N=133
4. **Peak heights stable** across zones
