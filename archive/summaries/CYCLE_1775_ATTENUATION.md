# Cycle 1775: Zone 9 and Attenuation

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1775
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Executive Summary

Investigated Zone 9 and attenuation mechanism.

**FINDING: Attenuation explained - uniformly high pairing at N>140**

---

## Results

### N = 141-159

| N | Rate |
|---|------|
| 141 | 80.4% |
| 145 | 85.3% |
| 149 | 84.5% |
| 153 | 83.7% |
| 159 | 84.9% |

**No clear peak - all values 78-85%**

---

## Attenuation Mechanism

### At Low N (20-140)

- Clear peaks (85-90%) at dead zones
- Troughs (60-75%) between zones
- Peak contrast creates pattern

### At High N (>140)

- Uniformly high pairing (78-85%)
- No distinct peaks or troughs
- Pattern attenuates

---

## Why This Happens

### Statistical Effect

At high N:
1. More agents → more pair combinations
2. Phase distribution averages out
3. All N values have similar pairing
4. No interference pattern

### Zone Width Narrowing

Zone width W(k) = 4/(1+k/3)
- Zone 1: Width = 4
- Zone 8: Width = 1.3
- Zone 9+: Width < 1 (unresolvable)

---

## Conclusions

1. **Zone 9 not clearly visible** (N=145-149 all similar)
2. **Attenuation = uniform high pairing**
3. **No peaks at high N** → no dead zones
4. **Statistical averaging** at large populations

## All Zones Summary

| Zone | Visible | Error |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1-8 | Yes | 0-2.5 |
| 9+ | No (attenuated) | N/A |
