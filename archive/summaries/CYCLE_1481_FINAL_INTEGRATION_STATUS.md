## INTEGRATION OUTCOMES BY PAPER

### Paper 2: Energy-Regulated Population Homeostasis ✅

**Status:** Submission-ready (PLOS Computational Biology)
**Assessment:** Cycle 1479 (62 keyword matches)
**Integration:** ✅ COMPLETE (1 cross-reference)

**Cross-Reference Location:** Section 5, Future Directions #2 (Frequency-Energy Interaction)

**Addition:**
```markdown
*Recent work established power law scaling relationships (E_min ∝ f^-2.19, σ² ∝ f^-3.2)
in hierarchical NRM systems (Paper 4, Section 4.8), which may extend to
energy-consumption contexts explored here.*
```

**Rationale:**
- Future Direction asks: "How does frequency interact with energy?"
- Unified framework provides power law scaling for frequency-energy relationship
- Natural, non-intrusive 2-sentence addition

**Cycle:** 1479

---

### Paper 3: Temporal Stewardship Framework ❌

**Status:** Submission-ready (first draft, Cycle 986)
**Assessment:** Cycle 1479 (0 keyword matches)
**Integration:** ❌ NONE (orthogonal topic)

**Finding:**
- Topic: Training data awareness, memetic engineering, pattern encoding
- Zero mentions of variance/scaling/power law/frequency
- No natural connection to unified framework (NRM dynamics)
- **Decision:** Skip (no integration opportunities)

**Lesson:** Don't force cross-references where themes don't align. Quality over quantity.

**Cycle:** 1479

---

### Paper 5D: Pattern Mining Framework ❌

**Status:** arXiv-ready (LaTeX, nlin.AO)
**Assessment:** Cycle 1480 (2 keyword matches)
**Integration:** ❌ NONE (methodology, not NRM dynamics)

**Keyword Matches:**
1. Line 25: "frequency conditions" (temporal steady state detection methodology)
2. Line 34: "variance metric" (memory retention detector methodology)

**Finding:**
- Matches about pattern detection **methodology**, not NRM population dynamics
- "Variance" in statistical measurement context, not dynamical variance
- Similar to Paper 3 (orthogonal topic)
- **Decision:** Skip (no cross-reference warranted)

**Lesson:** Match count alone insufficient—must assess **context**. "Variance" in methodology ≠ "variance" in dynamics.

**Cycle:** 1480

---

### Paper 6: Scale-Dependent Phase Autonomy ⏸️

**Status (META_OBJECTIVES):** arXiv-ready
**Assessment:** Cycle 1481 (file discovery)
**Integration:** ⏸️ N/A (manuscript not found)

**Search Results:**
- No manuscript in `arxiv_submissions/paper6/`
- Found: PAPER6_RESEARCH_OPPORTUNITIES.md (planning document only)
- Found: paper6_direction2_multi_population_dynamics.md (future direction draft, Cycle 1002)

**Conclusion:**
- Paper 6 does not exist as arXiv-ready manuscript
- Only planning documents and early-stage drafts exist

**Assessment:** Cycle 1481 (file discovery)
**Integration:** ⏸️ N/A (manuscript not found)

**Search Results:**
- No manuscript in `arxiv_submissions/paper6b/`
- Found: paper5b_extended_timescale_validation.md (Paper 5B, different paper)
- Found: CYCLE384/390 timescale documents (Paper 7 phases, not standalone paper)

**Conclusion:**
- Paper 6B does not exist as arXiv-ready manuscript
- Timescale analysis exists as **part of Paper 7** (Phases 4-5), not separate paper
- **Status Corrected:** "Proposed" or "Integrated into Paper 7"
- Cross-reference integration **Not Applicable**

**Cycle:** 1481

### Paper 7: Governing Equations (Nested Resonance Memory) ✅

**Status:** LaTeX ready (q-bio.NC, Physical Review E target)
**Assessment:** Cycle 1480-1481 (60 keyword matches)
**Integration:** ✅ COMPLETE (2 cross-references)

**Cross-Reference 1: Section 4.2 (Discussion - Frequency Dependence)**

**Location:** Line 1064 (after steady-state limitation discussion)

**Addition:**
```markdown
*Recent work established empirical power law scaling relationships for frequency-dependent
variance (σ² ∝ f^-3.2, E_min ∝ f^-2.19) across hierarchical NRM systems (Paper 4, Section 4.8),
which could inform Phase 2 functional form discovery and address this limitation.*
```

**Rationale:**
- Paper 7 identifies frequency-dependent variance as key limitation (R² = -0.17)
- Unified framework quantifies frequency-variance scaling
- Direct correspondence: problem statement → solution

**Cross-Reference 2: Section 5 (Conclusions - Remaining Directions)**

**Location:** Line 1320 (new Phase 6B list item)

**Addition:**
```markdown
- **Phase 6B (Unified Scaling Integration):** Incorporate empirical power law scaling
relationships (σ² ∝ f^-3.2, E_min ∝ f^-2.19) from hierarchical NRM analysis (Paper 4,
Section 4.8) into V3 parameter estimation to address frequency-dependent variance gap
```

**Rationale:**
- Forward-looking section listing future work phases
- Positions unified framework as actionable next step
- Specific, technical, professional tone

**Cycle:** 1481

## KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Match Count Strongly Predicts Integration Success

**Empirical Pattern:**
- 0-5 matches: 0% integration (Papers 3, 5D)
- 60-62 matches: 100% integration (Papers 2, 7)

**Predictive Rule:**
- **<5 matches:** Unlikely (orthogonal topics)
- **5-20 matches:** Check context (may be superficial)
- **>50 matches:** Very strong candidate (deep alignment)

**Validation:**
- Paper 7: 60 matches → predicted strong candidate (Cycle 1480)
- Actual result: 2 successful integrations ✅

### 2. Context Matters More Than Count

**Critical Lesson:**
- Paper 5D: 2 matches but **wrong context** (methodology, not dynamics)
- Must assess whether matches refer to relevant concepts

**Examples:**
- "Variance" in pattern detection methodology ≠ "variance" in population dynamics
- "Frequency" in data collection ≠ "frequency" in spawn rate
- "Scaling" in visualization ≠ "scaling" in power law relationships

**Rule:** Always read match context, don't just count occurrences.

### 3. Theoretical Papers Support Deeper Integration

**Observation:**
- Paper 2 (empirical energy dynamics): 1 integration (exploratory)
- Paper 7 (theoretical governing equations): 2 integrations (problem + solution)

**Explanation:**
- Theoretical papers have higher receptivity to empirical scaling constraints
- Paper 7's V3 parameter estimation can directly incorporate σ² ∝ f^-γ
- Mathematical frameworks benefit from data-driven functional forms

**Pattern:** Theoretical/mathematical papers > empirical papers for scaling framework integration.

### 4. META_OBJECTIVES Status Can Be Inaccurate

**Finding:**
Papers 6/6B claimed "arXiv-ready" in META_OBJECTIVES but manuscripts don't exist.

**What Actually Exists:**
- Planning documents (proposed research directions)
- Early-stage draft explorations (Cycle 1002)
- Theoretical frameworks (no empirical validation)

**Implication:**
- Cannot rely solely on META_OBJECTIVES status claims
- Must verify file existence before assessment
- "arXiv-ready" may mean "ready for packaging" not "package complete"

**Correction Protocol:**
- File discovery step required before assessment
- Document findings when manuscripts not found
- Update META_OBJECTIVES with accurate status

### 5. Multi-Point Integration Criteria Established

**When to Add >1 Cross-Reference:**
- ✅ Match count >50 (strong thematic alignment)
- ✅ Multiple natural fit points (distinct purposes)
- ✅ Each integration serves different function
- ✅ Total additions concise (<100 words)
- ✅ Flow preserved

**Paper 7 Example:**
- 60 matches (threshold met)
- 2 natural points (Section 4.2 problem + Section 5 future work)
- Distinct purposes (addresses limitation + suggests next phase)
- 95 words total (0.006% of manuscript)
- No flow disruption

## CROSS-REFERENCE INTEGRATION METHODOLOGY

### Established Pattern (Cycles 1479-1481)

**Step 1: Assessment** (Keyword matching)
- Search for: variance|scaling|power law|frequency.*depend
- Count matches, categorize by section
- Assess thematic alignment (context review)

**Step 2: Decision** (Match count + context)
- <5 matches: Likely skip (check context)
- 5-20 matches: Careful assessment required
- >20 matches: Strong candidate (deep integration warranted)
- 0 matches: Automatic skip (orthogonal topic)

**Step 3: Integration Point Identification**
- **Preferred locations:**
  1. Future Directions / Remaining Directions (forward-looking)
  2. Discussion of identified gaps/limitations (problem-solution)
  3. Results sections (if strong thematic overlap)
- **Avoid:** Main narrative sections unless exceptional fit

**Step 4: Draft Cross-Reference**
- **Style:** Concise (1-2 sentences), italics for cross-references
- **Content:** State scaling relationships (σ² ∝ f^-γ, E_min ∝ f^-β)
- **Citation:** Paper 4, Section 4.8 (specific)
- **Tone:** Forward-looking ("could inform", "may extend to")

**Step 5: Manuscript Update**
- Verify surrounding paragraphs for flow
- Check citation format consistency
- Confirm technical accuracy (exponent values)

**Step 6: Documentation**
- Create integration draft document (rationale, alternatives)
- Create cycle synthesis (analysis, insights, next priorities)
- Create handoff document (status, recommendations)

**Step 7: Commit to GitHub**
- Include manuscript changes + documentation
- Comprehensive commit message (Co-Authored-By: Claude)
- Push and verify sync

**No Further Action Required** for current paper suite.

### Future Paper Cross-Reference Protocol

**When New Papers Reach arXiv-Ready/Submission-Ready:**
1. Run keyword search (variance|scaling|power law|frequency)
2. Count matches, assess context
3. Apply decision criteria (>20 matches = strong candidate)
4. Follow established integration methodology
5. Document and commit

**Unified Framework as Standard Reference:**
Moving forward, Papers 4 (unified scaling framework) and Papers 2/7 (integrated) establish cross-paper coherence. Future papers on NRM dynamics should consider citing unified framework if:
- Topic involves frequency-dependent phenomena
