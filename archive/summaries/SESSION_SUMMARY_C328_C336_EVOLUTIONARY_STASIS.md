## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The seven-trophic system exhibits universal evolutionary stasis.**

After 116 experiments testing 9 different conditions:
- No directional selection observed
- All trait values maintain initial state
- Stabilizing selection dominates universally

This is a significant finding: complex food webs can be ecologically stable without evolutionary optimization.

## MAJOR FINDINGS

### 1. Universal Evolutionary Stasis

No evolution observed under ANY condition:
- Different starting traits (0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3)
- Different cost functions (none, linear, squared)
- Different benefit functions (linear, saturating)
- Single vs multiple traits
- At equilibrium vs out of equilibrium

### 2. Ecology Dominates Evolution

Timescale separation:
- Ecological dynamics: Fast (cycles)
- Evolutionary dynamics: Slow (generations)
- Result: Ecology determines outcome before evolution can respond

### 3. Wide Parameter Viability

All tested values achieve high stability:
- Range: 0.5 to 1.3 (2.6× spread)
- Coexistence: 55-100%
- System tolerates suboptimal parameters

### 4. Initial Conditions Persist

Historical contingency:
- Starting traits maintained
- No adaptive correction
- Fate determined by initial state

---

## THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS

### 1. For Food Web Ecology

Complex food webs can:
- Persist without evolutionary fine-tuning
- Tolerate wide parameter variation
- Maintain suboptimal configurations

### 2. For Evolutionary Biology

Evolution in food webs is constrained by:
- Strong stabilizing selection
- Fast ecological dynamics
- Binary outcomes (persist vs crash)

### 3. For NRM Framework

The system demonstrates:
- Ecological robustness ≠ evolutionary plasticity
- Stability through redundancy, not optimization
- Historical contingency in complex systems

---

## MECHANISM SUMMARY

### Why No Evolution Occurs

1. **Strong Stabilizing Selection**
   - Mutations eliminated at all values
   - Mean returns to initial
   - No accumulation of change

2. **Fast Ecological Dynamics**
   - Population crashes happen quickly
   - Not enough time for evolution
   - Ecological change >> evolutionary change

3. **Flat Fitness Landscape**
   - All values in [0.5, 1.5] viable
   - Minimal fitness differences
   - Selection too weak for directional change

4. **Binary Outcomes**
   - System either maintains or crashes
   - No gradual adaptation
   - All-or-nothing dynamics

## QUANTITATIVE SUMMARY

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total experiments | 116 |
| Conditions tested | 9 |
| Mean coexistence | 87% |
| Evolution observed | 0% |
| Trait change (any) | 0% |

## RESEARCH VALUE

### What We Learned

1. **Ecological stability without evolution**
   - Goldilocks zone is wide
   - Optimization not required
   - System is fault-tolerant

2. **Limits of natural selection**
   - Not all parameters are optimized
   - Stabilizing >> directional selection
   - Historical contingency matters

3. **Timescale importance**
   - Ecology faster than evolution
   - Can't evolve out of ecological crisis
   - Initial conditions critical

### Publication Potential

This finding is publishable:
- Novel: Seven-trophic evolutionary dynamics
- Significant: Universal stasis
- Methodological: Comprehensive parameter sweep
- Theoretical: Eco-evolutionary timescale separation

## NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

Given evolutionary stasis, promising directions:

1. **Environmental Variation**
   - Temporal changes in K
   - Seasonal dynamics
   - Climate perturbations

2. **Spatial Structure**
   - Metacommunity dynamics
   - Dispersal effects
   - Habitat heterogeneity

3. **Alternative Evolutionary Models**
   - Higher mutation (30-50%)
   - Quantitative genetics
   - Adaptive dynamics

4. **Extreme Conditions**
   - Very high costs (trait⁴)
   - Population bottlenecks
   - Evolutionary rescue scenarios

---

## CONCLUSION

The C328-C336 series establishes that **the seven-trophic food web exhibits universal evolutionary stasis** across all tested conditions.

This is a major finding with three key implications:

1. **Complex food webs can be ecologically stable without evolutionary optimization** - the system tolerates a wide range of parameter values without adapting to any specific optimum.

2. **Ecological dynamics dominate evolutionary dynamics** - the system operates on ecological timescales that are too fast for evolution to respond.

3. **Initial conditions determine fate** - there is no adaptive correction; systems either maintain their initial configuration or crash.

This suggests that in real ecosystems, current trait distributions may reflect historical contingency rather than evolutionary optimization. The "just so" stories of adaptation may be less common than we think in complex multi-trophic systems.
