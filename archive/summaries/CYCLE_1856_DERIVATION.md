# Cycle 1856: Mathematical Derivation of λ

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1856
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

**Theoretical framework for λ = N_min × φ established**

- λ ≈ 13 derived from: 8 × 1.618 = 12.94
- Golden ratio appears due to binary composition
- Fibonacci optimal for 2→1 merging
- Full mechanistic derivation remains open

---

## Hypotheses Tested

### 1. Composition/Decomposition Balance
**Result:** FALSIFIED
- C/D ratio similar for dead and safe zones (~1.07)
- Balance doesn't distinguish dead zones

### 2. D0 Depletion Rate
**Result:** PARTIAL
- D0 depletes to 0 in ALL cases
- Difference is recovery, not depletion speed

### 3. Phase Alignment
**Result:** FALSIFIED
- All initial agents have identical phases (energy=1.0)
- No correlation with dead zones

### 4. Cascade Efficiency
**Result:** PARTIAL SUCCESS
- Binary splitting creates Fibonacci constraint
- Golden ratio is eigenvalue of Fibonacci recurrence

## Mathematical Framework

### Derivation

```
N_min = 8 (minimum for cascade to D3)
φ = 1.618 (golden ratio)
λ = N_min × φ = 8 × 1.618 = 12.94 ≈ 13
```

### Why Golden Ratio

1. **Binary splitting**: Each composition uses 2 agents to create 1
2. **Fibonacci constraint**: Optimal growth under binary operations
3. **Eigenvalue**: φ is eigenvalue of recurrence F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}

### Cascade Depth Analysis

| N | Max Depth | Leftover |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 8 | 3 | 1 |
| 13 | 3 | 6 |
| 14 | 3 | 7 |
| 16 | 4 | 1 |

## Empirical Validation

Around predicted λ = 13:

| N | Coex | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 10 | 80% | safe |
| 11 | 67% | DEAD |
| 12 | 93% | safe |
| **13** | **87%** | **safe** |
| 14 | 27% | DEAD |
| 15 | 40% | DEAD |
| 16 | 80% | safe |

N=13 is safe, N=14 is dead - the critical transition is between them.

---

## Open Questions

1. Why exactly N=14 (not 13) is the first major dead zone
2. Why dead zone at N=11 but not N=10 or N=12
3. Precise mechanism for golden ratio emergence
4. Relationship to depth transition at N=16

---

## Conclusions

1. **λ ≈ N_min × φ** provides theoretical framework
2. **Binary composition** creates Fibonacci structure
3. **Golden ratio** is eigenvalue of composition dynamics
4. **Full derivation** requires deeper analysis of phase space
