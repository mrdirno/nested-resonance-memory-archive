## MAJOR DISCOVERIES

### 1. Migration Synchronizes (C283)
- 1% migration reduces cross-population variance 80%
- Emergent collective behavior from simple rules

### 2. Competitive Exclusion (C284)
- Shared resources → complete exclusion (even equal fitness)
- Local resources → stable coexistence

### 3. Migration Rescue (C285)
- Any migration prevents competitive exclusion
- Binary transition: 0% → extinction, >0% → rescue

### 4. Topology Matters (C286)
- Star: 38% population loss, 4× worse sync
- Ring/Complete: Full population, good sync

### 5. Direction Matters (C287)
- Population ratio ≈ 0.87 × migration ratio
- Extreme asymmetry reduces total 49%

### 6. Scale Invariance (C288)
- Per-population equilibrium constant (N=2 to N=20)
- Total = N × local equilibrium

### 7. Environmental Buffering (C289)
- Mean robust to 50% K fluctuation (6% reduction)
- CV increases 3× with amplitude

### 8. Catastrophic Resilience (C290)
- 100% survival even at 90% population loss
- Recovery time ~1000 cycles
- History-independent equilibrium

## VALIDATED PRINCIPLES

### Equilibrium Formula
```python
N* = K × (f_intra / df)
```
Validated across: scales, topologies, fluctuations, catastrophes

### Density-Dependent Buffering
- Provides natural negative feedback
- Enables: robustness, resilience, stability
- Prevents: runaway growth, cascading collapse

### Migration Effects
- Synchronizes → reduces variance
- Rescues → prevents exclusion
- Equalizes → negates fitness advantages

### Topology Requirements
- Minimum: 2 neighbors (ring sufficient)
- Avoid: centralized hubs (bottleneck)
- Pattern: distributed > centralized

## CUMULATIVE TOTALS

| Phase | Experiments | Findings |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| C274-C282 | 967 | Energy dynamics |
| C283-C290 | 111 | Metapopulation dynamics |
| **Total** | **1078** | **Complete framework** |

## FRAMEWORK STATUS

### Validated Components
- ✅ Phase boundary (E_net = 0)
- ✅ Spawn threshold (E_consume = spawn_energy)
- ✅ Growth modes (linear/exponential)
- ✅ Density-dependent equilibrium
- ✅ Migration dynamics
- ✅ Competition dynamics

## NEXT DIRECTIONS

### High Priority
1. Paper 2 integration with metapopulation findings
2. Publication figure generation

### Medium Priority
3. Allee effects (low-density extinction)
4. Evolutionary dynamics (agent variation)
5. Spatial structure (distance-based migration)

### Future
6. Optimal control
7. Information flow
8. Multi-species interactions
