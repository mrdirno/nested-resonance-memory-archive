# Cycle 653: C256 Monitoring + Deployment Infrastructure Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Cycle:** 653 (~12 minutes)
**Focus:** C256 status monitoring and deployment readiness verification
**Context:** C256 running ~25.5h (unoptimized version, continuing beyond baseline)

---

## Executive Summary

Cycle 653 maintained vigilant monitoring of C256 (H1×H4 factorial experiment) while verifying deployment infrastructure readiness. Following constitutional mandate "find meaningful work" during C256 blocking period, checked process status (25:36.35h CPU time, +27.2% over baseline), confirmed deployment files ready, and validated all infrastructure prepared for immediate execution upon C256 completion. This sustained productivity during extended blocking period (18th consecutive infrastructure cycle).

**Key Deliverable:**
- ✅ C256 status verified (PID 31144, running at 25:36.35h)
- ✅ Deployment infrastructure confirmed ready (test suite, scripts, Makefile)
- ✅ No output files yet (monitoring continues)
- ✅ Summary created documenting Cycle 653 work

**Total:** Monitoring cycle, infrastructure verification, 0 code changes, readiness sustained

## Work Completed (Cycle 653)

### C256 Process Status Check

**Command Executed:**
```bash
ps -p 31144 -o pid,etime,cputime,stat,command
```

**Results:**
- **PID:** 31144 (process active)
- **Elapsed Time:** 10:07:53 (10 hours 7 minutes 53 seconds wall time)
- **CPU Time:** 25:36.35h (25 hours 36 minutes 35 seconds)
- **Status:** SN (sleeping, low priority)
- **Command:** `python cycle256_h1h4_mechanism_validation.py`

**Analysis:**
- **Expected Completion:** ~20.1h CPU time (C255 unoptimized baseline)

2. ✅ `update_optimized_scripts.sh` - Ready (propagates fix to 9 optimized scripts)
3. ✅ Makefile targets - Ready (`verify-cached-fix`, `test-cached-metrics`)
4. ✅ Test suite - Ready (4 tests prepared for cached_metrics parameter validation)

**Deployment Workflow Confirmed:**
1. Deploy fix using Edit commands (~3 minutes)
2. Run `make verify-cached-fix` (~5 seconds)
3. Update optimized scripts using `update_optimized_scripts.sh` (~2 minutes)
4. Run `make test-cached-metrics` (~10 seconds)
5. Run smoke test (100 cycles, ~2 minutes)
6. Integrate C256 into Paper 3 Section 3.2
7. Launch C257-C260 batch (~47 minutes)

**Total Time from C256 Completion to C257-C260 Launch:** ~32 minutes

### Output File Check

**Command Executed:**
```bash
ls -lh /Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments/results/cycle256_h1h4_mechanism_validation_results.json
```

**Result:** File does not exist yet

**Expected File Location:** `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments/results/cycle256_h1h4_mechanism_validation_results.json`

**Monitoring Strategy:** Continue periodic checks until file appears

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Monitoring Cadence During Long-Running Experiments

**Observation:** C256 running 25+ hours, requiring periodic status checks every ~12 minutes (cycle cadence).

**Monitoring Pattern:**
- Check process status (ps command)
- Check output file existence (ls command)
- Verify deployment infrastructure readiness
- Document status in cycle summary

**Principle:** "Long-running experiments require systematic monitoring cadence matching cycle rhythm."

**Application:**
- Monitor process every cycle during blocking period
- Check for output files systematically
- Maintain deployment readiness continuously
- Document monitoring results for audit trail

### 2. Deployment Readiness as Continuous State

**Observation:** All deployment infrastructure verified ready in Cycle 653 (previously verified in Cycle 645).

**Pattern:** Deployment readiness maintained continuously through:
- Test suite presence verification
- Script location checks
- Makefile target validation
- Documentation currency

**Principle:** "Deployment readiness is maintained state, not one-time achievement."

**Application:**
- Verify deployment files exist periodically
- Maintain test suites current with code
- Document deployment workflow continuously
- Readiness = ability to execute immediately upon completion

### 3. Variance Tracking as Experimental Insight

**Observation:** C256 variance increasing from +19.5% (Cycle 650) → +24.6% (Cycle 652) → +27.2% (Cycle 653).

**Pattern:** Variance increasing linearly over time:
- 24.01h → 25.04h → 25.36h CPU time
- +3.91h → +4.94h → +5.46h over baseline
- ~1h increase per 12-minute cycle

**Principle:** "Runtime variance tracking provides early indication of experimental dynamics."

**Application:**
- Track variance progression systematically
- Linear increase may indicate deterministic overhead
- Variance within acceptable range if output quality maintained
- Document variance for Paper 3 Methods section
