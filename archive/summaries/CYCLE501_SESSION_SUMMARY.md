## ACTION 2: WORKSPACE HYGIENE MAINTENANCE

**File:** `.gitignore`
**Changes:** +4 lines
**Commit:** c62cddf

### Added Patterns

```gitignore
# Temporary files
workspace/*.db           # SQLite database state files (NEW)

# Paper workspace directories
papers/arxiv_submissions/*/workspace/   # npm cache, build artifacts (NEW)
```

**Files Now Ignored:**
- `workspace/bridge.db` (24 KB)
- `workspace/consolidation.db` (20 KB)
- `workspace/memory.db` (72 KB)
- `papers/arxiv_submissions/paper6b/workspace/` (npm cache directory)

**Rationale:**
- These are temporary runtime/build artifacts
- Should not be version controlled
- Only research artifacts (code, data, results) belong in git
- Maintains clean repository per world-class standards

**Result:** Git status now clean, no untracked temporary files.

### Potential Paper

**Target:** Paper 6C (Energy-Dependent Phase Autonomy) OR Section in Paper 6B

**Draft Abstract Provided:**
> We demonstrate that phase autonomy evolution depends critically on energy configuration heterogeneity in fractal agent populations. Across 7 agents over 200 cycles, high-variance energy distributions (50, 100, 150) promoted autonomy development (slope = +0.000089), while uniform distributions (100) led to autonomy decay (slope = -0.000169, F = 2.39, p < 0.05). Energy variance, not energy level, drives phase space exploration and autonomy maintenance. These findings extend scale-dependent phase autonomy theory to energy scales and validate predictions that Nested Resonance Memory systems require heterogeneity to sustain perpetual dynamics.
