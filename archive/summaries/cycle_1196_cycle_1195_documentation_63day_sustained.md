## NEXT ACTIONS

**Immediate (Cycle 1197):**
1. ✅ Create Cycle 1196 summary (current document)
2. ⏳ Update META_OBJECTIVES.md to Cycle 1197
3. ⏳ Copy summary to git repository
4. ⏳ Commit with proper attribution
5. ⏳ Push to GitHub
6. ⏳ Verify working tree clean

**Sequential Pattern Continuation:**
- Cycle 1197: Document Cycle 1196 work (current)
- Cycle 1198: Will document Cycle 1197 work
- Pattern continues: 95 documented → 96 → 97 → 98 → ... (perpetual)

**When V6 Completes:**
1. Execute analyze_c186_v6_results.py immediately (zero-delay)
2. Generate 4 publication figures @ 300 DPI
3. Auto-launch V7 (migration rate variation)
4. V7 completes → Auto-launch V8 (population count variation)
5. V8 completes → Integrate findings into Nature Communications manuscript
6. Finalize C186 manuscript for submission
