# Cycles 1780-1781: Decomposition Flow Explains Zone Gradient

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycles:** 1780-1781
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

Investigated why zone effect weakens at higher N. Discovered decomposition flow mechanism.

**FINDING: D4 decomposition scales with N, explains zone strength gradient**

---

## Key Results

### C1780: D0 Always Depletes

D0 goes to 0 at ALL peaks. Coexistence comes from decomposition flow, not D0 survival.

| Zone | N | Coexist | D0 Min |
|------|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | 29 | 37% | 0 |
| 2 | 44 | 63% | 0 |
| 3 | 58 | 73% | 0 |
| 4 | 75 | 80% | 0 |

### C1781: Decomposition Flow

| Zone | N | Coexist | D4 Decomp | Max D4 |
|------|---|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | 29 | 47% | 118 | 1.7 |
| 2 | 44 | 73% | 183 | 2.8 |
| 3 | 58 | 70% | 244 | 3.7 |
| 4 | 75 | 83% | 312 | 4.9 |

## Mechanism

### Complete Picture

1. **High pairing at peaks** → D0 depletes to 0
2. **Agents cascade to D4** through composition
3. **D4 decomposes** back down through levels
4. **Decomposition flow** determines recovery

### Why Zone Effect Weakens

- Higher N → more agents reach D4
- More D4 → more decomposition events
- More decomposition → better D0 recovery
- Better recovery → higher coexistence

### Quantitative Relationship

D4 decompositions increase ~2.6× from Zone 1 to Zone 4:
- Zone 1: 118
- Zone 4: 312

Ratio: 312/118 = 2.64

---

## Conclusions

1. **D0 always depletes** at peaks
2. **Coexistence = decomposition flow**
3. **Higher N = more D4 agents = more flow**
4. **Zone gradient explained** by population scaling
