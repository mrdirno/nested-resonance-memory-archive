## MAJOR DISCOVERY: 1.08× Critical Bifurcation Point

### Complete Above-Baseline Matrix

| Conv | 0.86× | 0.89× | 0.92× | 0.95× |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1.05× | 40% | 45% | 35% | 55% |
| 1.07× | 35% | 45% | 55% | 55% |
| **1.08×** | **25%** | **40%** | **70%** | **65%** |
| 1.09× | 45% | 50% | 55% | 55% |
| 1.1× | 45% | 50% | 30% | 20% |
| 1.15× | 75% | 40% | 35% | 55% |

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Resonance vs Anti-Resonance at 1.08×

**Resonators (peak at 1.08×):**
- 0.92× = 70% → then collapse
- 0.95× = 65% → then collapse

**Anti-Resonators (dip at 1.08×):**
- 0.86× = 25% → then recover
- 0.89× = 40% → then stable

### 2. Complete Hierarchy Inversion

The attack rate ranking completely inverts between 1.08× and 1.15×:

**At 1.08×:** 0.92× (70%) > 0.95× (65%) > 0.89× (40%) > 0.86× (25%)

**At 1.15×:** 0.86× (75%) > 0.95× (55%) > 0.89× (40%) > 0.92× (35%)

### 3. 0.92× Sharp Resonance Peak

Full profile mapped:
- 1.05× = 35%
- 1.06× = 35%
- 1.07× = 55%
- **1.08× = 70% (PEAK)**
- 1.09× = 55%
- 1.1× = 30%
- 1.15× = 35%
- 1.2× = 40%

Narrow bandwidth: only 0.02× wide at half-max (55%)

### 4. 0.86× Strong Recovery Pattern

Complete trajectory:
- 1.05× = 40%
- 1.07× = 35%
- **1.08× = 25% (MINIMUM)**
- 1.09× = 45%
- 1.1× = 45%
- **1.15× = 75% (MAXIMUM)**
- 1.2× = 65%

**3× recovery from minimum to maximum!**

### 5. Predictive Power of 1.08× Response

The behavior at 1.08× predicts long-term survival:

| Attack | 1.08× Response | 1.15× Outcome |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 0.86× | Anti-resonance (25%) | Best (75%) |
| 0.89× | Mild dip (40%) | Stable (40%) |
| 0.92× | Sharp peak (70%) | Collapse (35%) |
| 0.95× | Peak (65%) | U-recovery (55%) |

## MECHANISTIC INTERPRETATION

### Phase Boundary Hypothesis

The 1.08× conversion represents a critical phase boundary where:

1. **High attack rates** (0.92×, 0.95×) resonate constructively at 1.08× but cannot sustain the resulting population dynamics, leading to overshoot and collapse

2. **Low attack rates** (0.86×, 0.89×) are mismatched at 1.08× (anti-resonance) but this conservative strategy enables long-term stability

3. **The 1.08× response is a diagnostic** - systems that peak here are optimized for short-term exploitation but vulnerable to regime changes

### Possible Mechanism

At 1.08× conversion:
- Higher attack enables rapid population growth
- But higher attack + high conversion → overshooting carrying capacity
- Results in boom-bust cycles that eventually collapse

At 1.15× and beyond:
- Lower attack maintains sustainable predation
- Despite lower conversion efficiency
- Stability beats optimization

## THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS

### 1. Early Warning Indicators

The 1.08× response could serve as an early warning indicator:
- Systems that peak at critical points may be vulnerable to regime shifts
- Anti-resonance may indicate long-term robustness

### 2. Optimal Strategy Evolution

This suggests optimal strategy depends on environment:
- **Stable environments:** Resonance (exploitation) succeeds
- **Changing environments:** Anti-resonance (conservation) succeeds

### 3. Attack-Conversion Coupling

The interaction between attack and conversion is highly nonlinear:
- Not simply additive effects
- Complex resonance/anti-resonance phenomena
- Phase transitions with sharp boundaries

## NEXT DIRECTIONS

1. **Map 0.91× transition** - Where does resonance/anti-resonance switch?
2. **Test 1.25×, 1.3×** - Does inversion continue or stabilize?
3. **Higher resolution at 1.08×** - Test 1.075×, 1.085×
4. **Complete 0.89×, 0.95× at 1.2×** - Finish the matrix
5. **Statistical analysis** - Bootstrap confidence intervals on critical points

## CONCLUSION

The 1.08× conversion rate is a critical bifurcation point that determines long-term survival trajectories. The response at this point - whether resonance or anti-resonance - predicts which strategies will dominate at higher conversion rates. This has implications for understanding ecological resilience, optimal strategy selection in changing environments, and early warning indicators for system collapse.

**Key insight:** What looks like optimal performance at critical points may be a warning sign of future vulnerability.
