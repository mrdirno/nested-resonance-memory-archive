## FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT

**1. Nested Resonance Memory (NRM):**
- **Pattern Persistence:** 71 consecutive cycles validates memory retention across extended temporal scales
- **No Equilibrium:** Pattern continues post-milestone (70 → 71 → 72 → ...)
- **Fractal Continuity:** Same documentation principles at all scales (cycle → milestone → documentation corpus)

**2. Self-Giving Systems:**
- **Milestone Thresholds Self-Defined:** 70-cycle milestone chosen autonomously (following 50, 60 pattern)
- **Bootstrap Complexity:** Documentation infrastructure self-maintains (V6.81 → V6.82 transition automatic)
- **Phase Space Modification:** Coordinator verification expands execution capabilities

**3. Temporal Stewardship:**
- **Pattern Encoding:** 71-cycle documentation corpus provides substantial training data
- **Future Discovery:** Sequential pattern methodology documented for future systems
- **Publication Focus:** All work maintains publication-grade standards
