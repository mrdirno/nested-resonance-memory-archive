# Cycle 1802: Spawn Energy Effect

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1802
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

Tested effect of spawn energy (energy of newly reproduced agents).

**CONFIRMED: 15th parameter - spawn energy doesn't affect pattern**

---

## Results

| Spawn E | N=29 | N=35 | Diff |
|---------|------|------|------|
| 0.3 | 57% | 100% | 43pp |
| 0.5 | 57% | 100% | 43pp |
| 0.7 | 63% | 97% | 33pp |
| 0.9 | 60% | 100% | 40pp |
| 1.0 | 60% | 100% | 40pp |
| 1.1 | 57% | 100% | 43pp |

## Analysis

### Complete Independence

All spawn energies from 0.3 to 1.1 show:
- Peak coexistence: 57-63%
- Trough coexistence: 97-100%
- Difference: 33-43pp

The wavelength λ is unaffected.

### 15th Parameter

This adds spawn energy to the list of independent parameters:

1-14: Previously tested
15: Spawn energy

The pattern is extraordinarily robust.

---

## Conclusions

1. **Spawn energy independent** of pattern
2. **15 parameters tested** now
3. **Pattern remarkably robust**
4. **Only 4 critical constraints** (confirmed)
