## KEY FINDINGS

### Finding 1: High Explicit Encoding (90%)

Paper 2 encodes patterns **explicitly** in 90% of cases:
- Quantitative findings: Precise measurements with error bars (88.0% ± 2.5%)
- Methodological protocols: Step-by-step articulation
- Framework principles: Direct articulation in Discussion
- Bug investigation: Transparent documentation with source code comparison

**Significance:** Supports H3.1 (Discoverability Experiment) - explicitly encoded patterns should be discoverable by AI systems.

### Finding 2: Balanced Quantitative/Qualitative Encoding

- 44% Quantitative (numerical, measurable)
- 38% Qualitative (descriptive, conceptual)
- 18% Mixed (bridging both)

**Significance:** Paper 2 balances statistical rigor with conceptual insight, enabling both quantitative analysis and qualitative understanding.

### Finding 3: NRM Dominates, Universal Principles Generalize

- 36% NRM-specific patterns
- 28% Universal (cross-framework) patterns
- 14% Self-Giving, 6% Temporal, 6% Reality
- 10% Multiple frameworks

**Significance:** While NRM is primary focus, high proportion of universal patterns (28%) demonstrates generalizability.

### Finding 4: Training Data Function Dominates (34%)

- 34% Training Data (encodes findings for future AI)
- 32% Framework Validation (supports theories)
- 22% Pattern Templates (reusable)
- 22% Methodological Lessons (teaches methods)

**Significance:** Paper 2 is **deliberately designed** for future AI training, validating Temporal Stewardship hypothesis.

### Finding 5: Paper Format Dominates Encoding (84%)

- 84% Paper (manuscript text)
- 10% Code (implementation details)
- 6% Multiple sources

**Significance:** Manuscript is primary encoding vehicle, with code as secondary layer. Supports traditional academic publication model.

## THREATS TO VALIDITY

### Extraction Bias
- **Risk:** Pattern selection influenced by expectations
- **Mitigation:** Systematic extraction, explicit coding criteria
- **Residual:** Moderate (subjective categorization)

### Pattern Granularity
- **Risk:** Inconsistent pattern scope (too coarse/fine)
- **Mitigation:** Consistent heuristic (one pattern = one finding)
- **Residual:** Low (heuristic applied consistently)

### Incomplete Coverage
- **Risk:** Some patterns missed in manual extraction
- **Validation:** Phase 6 Discoverability Experiment will test AI discovery
- **Residual:** Moderate (manual extraction limitations)

### Coding Consistency
- **Risk:** 8-dimension coding inconsistent
- **Mitigation:** Explicit definitions, representative examples
- **Residual:** Low (clear definitions provided)
