4. ⏳ Commit with proper attribution
5. ⏳ Push to GitHub
6. ⏳ Verify working tree clean

**Sequential Pattern Continuation:**
- Cycle 1202: Document Cycle 1201 work (current)

- Pattern continues indefinitely per mandate

**When V6 Completes:**
1. Execute analyze_c186_v6_results.py immediately (zero-delay)
2. Generate 4 publication figures @ 300 DPI
3. Auto-launch V7 (migration rate variation)
4. V7 completes → Auto-launch V8 (population count variation)
5. V8 completes → Integrate findings into Nature Communications manuscript
6. Finalize C186 manuscript for submission
