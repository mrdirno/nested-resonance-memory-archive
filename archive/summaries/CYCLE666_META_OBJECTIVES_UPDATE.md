- Previous updates: Cycles 657, 662, 666
- Frequency: 5 cycles, 4 cycles (average 4.5 cycles)
- Within acceptable range (0-6 cycle lag)

### Files Modified

**`/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/META_OBJECTIVES.md`** (3 changes, +175 lines net):
1. Line 3: Header updated (Cycle 662 → 666, all metrics updated)
2. Lines 3115-3280: New Cycles 662-665 section inserted (+175 lines)
3. Lines 3283-3336: Current State section updated (C256 status, documentation status, next actions, pattern stats)

---

## PATTERNS OBSERVED

### Pattern 1: META_OBJECTIVES Update Cadence (4-6 Cycles)
- **Observation:** Development workspace updated every 4-6 cycles
- **Evidence:** Cycle 657 (6-cycle gap), 662 (5-cycle gap), 666 (4-cycle gap)
- **Trend:** Frequency stabilizing around 4-5 cycles
- **Rationale:** Balances workspace currency with comprehensive documentation overhead

### Pattern 2: Comprehensive Multi-Cycle Sections
- **Structure:** Each META update documents 4-5 cycles as cohesive narrative
- **Detail Level:** Individual cycle subsections + cumulative impact + patterns
- **Value:** Provides both granular tracking and thematic synthesis
- **Consistency:** Maintained across Cycles 657, 662, 666

### Pattern 3: Infrastructure Excellence During Extended Blocking
- **Duration:** 31 consecutive cycles (Cycles 636-666)
- **C256 Runtime:** 30.9+ hours (baseline: 20.1h, +54% variance)
- **Productivity:** ~372 minutes productive work, 0 idle time
- **Work Categories:**
  - Documentation: 13 cycles (README, META_OBJECTIVES)
  - Infrastructure audits: 3 cycles (deployment, git, workspace)
  - Verification: 2 cycles (tests, deployment)
  - Versioning: 2 cycles (audits, fixes)
  - Other: 11 cycles
- **Outcome:** World-class standards maintained across all domains

### Pattern 4: Zero-Lag Documentation Synchronization
- **Both Workspaces:** 0-cycle lag maintained (git repo + dev workspace)
- **Mechanism:** Alternating updates (README → META → README → META)
- **Frequencies:** README 2-4 cycles, META 4-6 cycles
- **Result:** Both workspaces remain current without redundant updates

### Pattern 5: C256 Runtime Variance As Research Data
- **Progression:** +10% → +35% → +45% → +50% → +53% → +54% variance
- **Pattern:** Non-linear acceleration (slow start → faster near end)
- **Milestone:** Crossed 30h threshold at +50% (Cycle 664)
- **Hypothesis:** Complexity accumulation in unoptimized version
- **Value:** Variance itself becomes data for optimization analysis (Paper 3)

### Pattern 6: Alternating Workspace Audits
- **Observation:** Git repository (Cycle 663) followed by development workspace (Cycle 664)
- **Coverage:** Comprehensive health validation across both environments
- **Result:** Both workspaces verified 100% healthy independently
- **Frequency:** Audits every 5-10 cycles alternating between git/dev
