## WORK COMPLETED

### Documentation Synchronization ✅

**Issue Identified:** README.md listed Paper 8 under "In Development" with outdated status "(compiled, needs final review)", despite Cycle 1489 completing full arXiv submission package.

**Action:** Updated README.md to reflect Paper 8's actual status

**Changes:**
1. **Moved Paper 8** from "In Development" section to "Submission-Ready Papers" section
2. **Updated title** from generic "Memory Fragmentation as Runtime Variance Source" to official "Validated Gates for Nested Resonance Memory Systems: A Reference Instrument"
3. **Updated status** from "(compiled, needs final review)" to "(arXiv-ready, cs.AI)"
4. **Added package details:** "Complete package: LaTeX manuscript (1,073 lines), 6 figures @ 300 DPI, arXiv submission guide, per-paper README, 79/79 tests passing"

**Before:**
```markdown
#### In Development
- Paper 8: Memory Fragmentation as Runtime Variance Source (compiled, needs final review)
```

**After:**
```markdown
#### Submission-Ready Papers
8. **Paper 8:** Validated Gates for Nested Resonance Memory Systems: A Reference Instrument (arXiv-ready, cs.AI) - *Complete package: LaTeX manuscript (1,073 lines), 6 figures @ 300 DPI, arXiv submission guide, per-paper README, 79/79 tests passing*
```

### Submission-Ready Papers Count Update ✅

**Before Cycle 1489:** 8 submission-ready papers
**After Cycle 1490:** 9 submission-ready papers (Papers 1, 2, 5D, 6, 6B, 7, Topology, **8**, 9)

**In Development:** 2 papers (Papers 3, 4)

### GitHub Synchronization ✅

**Git Commit:** ecbf1a5
**Commit Message:** "Update README.md: Paper 8 now arXiv-ready"

## REPOSITORY STATUS

**Git:** Clean, 100% synchronized (3 commits pushed)
**Papers Ready:** 9 (Papers 1, 2, 5D, 6, 6B, 7, Topology, 8, 9)
**Papers In Development:** 2 (Papers 3, 4)
**V6 Status:** 12.8h to 7-day milestone (~Nov 12 16:00 PST)
**Infrastructure:** All current (9.3/10 reproducibility, MOG 85%+)
**Documentation:** Consistent and professional across repository

## STRATEGIC POSITIONING

### Cycles 1485-1488: Maintenance Mode
- V6 monitoring only (passive)
- No high-leverage work identified
- 4 brief verification cycles

### Cycle 1489: High-Leverage Action
- Autonomous due diligence identified Paper 8 gap
- Completed submission package infrastructure
- Brought Paper 8 to 100% arXiv-ready status
- **Broke out of maintenance mode with real progress**

### Cycle 1490: Follow-Through
- Documentation synchronization
- README.md consistency maintained
- Professional presentation ensured

### Current State: Return to Maintenance Mode
- V6: 12.8h to milestone (passive monitoring only)
- C256: Weeks-months to completion (passive)
- 9 papers: Await user submission (external dependency)
- All documentation current and synchronized

**Assessment:** Cycles 1489-1490 demonstrated perpetual operation mandate successfully. No terminal state declared. Identified real high-leverage work (Paper 8), executed completely, synchronized documentation, now positioned for next milestone (V6 in 12.8h).

---

## NEXT ACTION

**Immediate:** Monitor V6 approaching 7-day milestone (~12.8h remaining, ~Nov 12 16:00 PST)

**Upon V6 Completion:**
1. Document milestone achievement
2. Check V6 status (CPU, memory, database, output)
3. Execute Paper 4 assembly workflow (~6 hours to arXiv-ready)
4. Create comprehensive V6 milestone summary
5. Commit to GitHub
6. **Brings total to 10 papers arXiv-ready**

**Alternative:** User paper submissions (9 ready, 2-3 hours user time)

**Medium-Term:** C256 completion (weeks-months) → Paper 3 completion
