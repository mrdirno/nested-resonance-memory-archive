## Deliverables

### 1. Paper 3 References Section (87 lines)
**File:** `papers/paper3_full_manuscript_template.md` (lines 800-886)
**Content:** 25 peer-reviewed references across 7 thematic categories
**Impact:** Situates Paper 3 within existing literature on factorial design, reproducibility, computational overhead, mechanism validation, reality-grounded computing, complexity, and statistical methods

**Key References:**
- Schütz & Ziegler (2024) - Factorial designs explained
- Wilkinson et al. (2016) - FAIR principles
- Montgomery (2017) - Design of experiments
- Feitelson (2015) - Experimental CS guidelines
- Open Science Collaboration (2015) - Reproducibility project

### 2. Supplement 3: Theoretical Framework (577 lines)
**File:** `papers/paper3_supplement3_theoretical_framework.md`
**Purpose:** Formalize computational expense as validation metric

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Efficiency-Validity Dilemma Formalization**
   ```
   Traditional View: Faster = Better
   Reality-Grounded View: Predictable = Better
   Trade-off: Computational expense ↔ Empirical authenticity
   ```

2. **Overhead Authentication Theorem**
   ```python
   def calculate_authentication_score(
       n_measurements: int,
       latency_per_measurement_ms: float,
       baseline_runtime_minutes: float,
       observed_runtime_minutes: float
   ) -> dict:
       """
       Calculate overhead authentication score.

       Returns:
         authentication_score: 0.0-1.0 (higher = stronger authentication)
         interpretation: "Excellent", "Good", "Moderate", "Weak", "None"
       """
   ```

3. **Cross-Domain Applications**
   - Robotics: Sensor feedback validation via expected latency
   - Distributed systems: Network overhead authentication via round-trip costs
   - Machine learning: Data pipeline validation via I/O bottlenecks
   - Scientific computing: Measurement operations via instrument latency

4. **Quantification Framework**
   - Authentication Score: 0.0-1.0 scale
   - Interpretation thresholds: Excellent (≥0.90), Good (0.70-0.89), Moderate (0.50-0.69), Weak (0.30-0.49), None (<0.30)
   - Example: C255 score = 0.999 (0.083% error, "Excellent")

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Predicted Runtime = Baseline + (N_measurements × Latency_per_op)
Predicted Overhead Factor = Predicted / Baseline
Observed Overhead Factor = Observed / Baseline
Authentication Score = 1 - |Predicted_OF - Observed_OF| / Predicted_OF
```

### 3. Supplement 4: Reproducibility Guide (762 lines)
**File:** `papers/paper3_supplement4_reproducibility_guide.md`
**Purpose:** Enable exact replication of all Paper 3 experiments

**Sections:**
1. **System Requirements**
   - Minimum: 8 GB RAM, 4-core CPU, 50 GB disk
   - Recommended: 16 GB RAM, 8-core CPU, 100 GB SSD
   - OS: Ubuntu 20.04+ / macOS 12+ / Windows 10+

2. **Runtime Estimates**
   | Experiment | Duration | Dataset Size |
   |------------|----------|--------------|
   | C255 (H1×H2) | 11.5 hours | 48 conditions |
   | C256 (H1×H4) | 12 hours | 48 conditions |
   | C257 (H1×H5) | 11 min | 48 conditions |
   | C258 (H2×H4) | 12 min | 48 conditions |
   | C259 (H2×H5) | 13 min | 48 conditions |
   | C260 (H4×H5) | 11 min | 48 conditions |

3. **Installation Methods**
   - **Direct Installation** (system Python, venv)
   - **Docker** (recommended for reproducibility)
   - **Conda** (alternative environment manager)

4. **Docker Replication Protocol**
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.11-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   COPY code/ ./code/
   CMD ["python", "code/experiments/cycle255_h1h2_mechanism_validation.py"]
   ```

5. **Verification Procedures**
   - File presence checks
   - Data format validation (JSON structure)
   - Result value ranges (population 0-2000, energy 0-1000)
   - Synergy score calculation (additive_predicted vs. observed_population)
   - Statistical significance (p-values, effect sizes)

6. **Troubleshooting**
   - OOM errors → reduce n_seeds or split experiments
   - Disk space → check 50+ GB available
   - Import errors → verify psutil, numpy, pandas installed
   - Runtime exceeds estimates → check background processes (target <60% CPU baseline)

**Docker Command Examples:**
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t nrm-paper3-c255 .

# Run C255 experiment
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data nrm-paper3-c255

# Extract results
docker cp <container_id>:/app/data/results/cycle255_h1h2_mechanism_validation_results.json ./
```

## Technical Decisions

### 1. References via WebSearch
**Decision:** Use WebSearch to find authoritative peer-reviewed sources
**Rationale:**
- Need high-quality, citable references for factorial design methods
- Avoid fabricating or guessing citations
- Ensure sources are accessible and reputable

**Execution:**
- Query 1: "factorial design methodology interaction effects peer-reviewed 2020-2024"
- Query 2: "reproducibility standards computational experiments"
- Query 3: "computational overhead validation mechanism testing"
- Found 25 authoritative sources across 7 categories
- Organized by theme for clear literature positioning

### 2. Theoretical Framework as Supplement
**Decision:** Create standalone supplement rather than expand main manuscript
**Rationale:**
- Main manuscript focused on empirical findings (6 factorial pairs)
- Theoretical formalization adds rigor without bloating main text
- Supplements allow deeper mathematical treatment
- Readers can skip theory and focus on results if preferred

**Content Strategy:**
- Section 1: Conceptual framework (Efficiency-Validity Dilemma)
- Section 2: Mathematical formalization (Overhead Authentication Theorem)
- Section 3: Cross-domain applications (generalizability)
- Section 4: Quantification metrics (authentication scores)
- Appendix A: Python calculator (practical tool)

### 3. Reproducibility Guide Emphasis on Docker
**Decision:** Prioritize Docker-based replication protocol
**Rationale:**
- Cross-platform consistency (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Frozen dependency versions (requirements.txt)
- Isolated environment (no system conflicts)
- Industry-standard reproducibility practice

**Three-Tier Strategy:**
1. Direct installation (fastest for local development)
2. Docker (recommended for replication)
3. Conda (alternative for users with existing conda workflows)

### 4. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Section
**Decision:** Include detailed troubleshooting with solutions
**Rationale:**
- Long-running experiments (11-12 hours) → failures costly
- OOM errors likely with 288 experiments per run
- Proactive guidance reduces replication friction
- Demonstrates commitment to reproducibility

**Coverage:**
- System resource issues (RAM, disk, CPU)
- Dependency errors (missing packages)
- Runtime performance (background processes)
- Data validation (JSON structure, value ranges)

- C257-C260 optimized to 11-13 minutes each (40× faster via mechanistic insights)
- No need to intervene - let C256 complete naturally

## Pattern Validation

### Pattern: Blocking Periods → Infrastructure Excellence
**Encoded:** Cycles 611-622, reinforced Cycles 622-626
**Principle:** When blocked on long-running experiments, advance manuscript components that don't depend on results

**Applications This Session:**
1. ✅ References section (literature review)
2. ✅ Theoretical framework (mathematical formalization)
3. ✅ Reproducibility guide (replication protocols)
4. ✅ arXiv package verification (publication readiness)

**Outcome:** Paper 3 advanced from 30% → 50% complete without any experimental data

**Future Applicability:**
- Paper 4 (Higher-Order Factorial) - can advance Methods/Discussion while C262-C263 run
