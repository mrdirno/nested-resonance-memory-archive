## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**1. Systematic Figure Planning**
Creating all 9 figures in a single script with consistent styling ensured visual coherence across the paper.

**2. Data-Driven Visualizations**
Loading PC specifications from JSON files made figures accurate and automatically synchronized with validation results.

**3. Professional Styling**
Using seaborn publication themes and 300 DPI from the start eliminated need for reformatting.

**4. Reproducible Workflow**
Single script (`generate_figures.py`) allows complete figure regeneration if data/specifications change.

### Challenges Encountered

**1. Path Resolution**
Initial bug with `PC_DIR` path (needed 4 parent levels, not 3). Fixed by adjusting `Path(__file__).parent` chain.

**2. Font Warnings**
Missing glyphs for special characters (∈, ✅) in Arial/DejaVu Sans. Non-critical; figures still render correctly.

**3. Multi-Scale Visualization**
Figure 5 required dual y-axes for trend/volatility (%) vs price ($) scales. Handled with `ax.twinx()`.
