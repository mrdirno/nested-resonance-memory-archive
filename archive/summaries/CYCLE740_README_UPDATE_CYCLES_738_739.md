## Work Completed (Cycle 740)

### README.md Update (Cycles 738-739)

**Problem Identified:**
README.md last updated Cycle 737, creating 2-cycle lag (737→740). Per pattern established across Cycles 732-740, documentation should maintain 1-3 cycle lag maximum through proactive updates.

## Experiment Status Updates

### C257 (H1×H5 - Ongoing) - Variance Continuing Beyond +750%

**Observations (Cycle 740):**

| Time | Wall Time | CPU Time | CPU % | Variance | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Cycle 739 end | ~83.87 min | ~3.34 min | 2.2% | +663% | Documented in Cycle 739 |
| Cycle 740 start | ~93.58 min | ~3.71 min | 2.8% | +751% | README.md check |
| Cycle 740 end | ~95.67 min | ~3.79 min | 2.4% | +770% | Final observation |

**Pattern Analysis:**
- **Variance Acceleration:** +663% → +751% → +770% over ~12 minutes
- **CPU Oscillation:** 2.2% → 2.8% → 2.4% (continuing late-phase pattern)
- **Wall/CPU Ratio:** 95.67 / 3.79 = 25.2× (96.0% time waiting for I/O)
- **Still No Results:** After 95.67 minutes, no output JSON file created

**Implication:**
C257 remains in extreme I/O-bound phase after 95+ minutes. Variance has crossed +750% threshold (7.7× expected runtime), demonstrating systematic I/O dominance pattern consistent with heterogeneous overhead analysis. CPU oscillation (2-5% range) appears normal for late execution phase.

### C256 (H1×H4 - Ongoing) - Stable Continuation

**Observation (Cycle 740):**

| Metric | Value | Change from Cycle 739 | Variance |
|--------|-------|----------------------|----------|
| Wall Time | 28 hours 1 minute | +10 min | +39% wall |
| CPU Time | 66.7 hours | +0.2 hours | +232% |
| Status | Running (PID 31144) | Stable | Ongoing |

**Variance Evolution:**
- Cycle 738: +230%
- Cycle 739: +231%
- Cycle 740: +232%

**Pattern:** Variance continues slow systematic acceleration (~+1% per 10 minutes)

## Pattern Assessment

### 9-Cycle Documentation Maintenance (Cycles 732-740)

**Documentation Lag History:**

| Cycle | README.md Last Updated | Lag | Action |
|-------|------------------------|-----|--------|
| 732 | Cycle 666 | 66 cycles | Major update (infrastructure→research) |
| 733 | Cycle 732 | 1 cycle | README updated with Cycle 732 |
| 734 | Cycle 732 | 2 cycles | Minor lag (research output focus) |
| 735 | Cycle 733 | 2 cycles | Acceptable lag (orchestration focus) |
| 736 | Cycle 733 | 3 cycles | Update executed (added Cycles 734-736) |
| 737 | Cycle 736 | 1 cycle | Acceptable lag (orchestration focus) |
| 738 | Cycle 736 | 2 cycles | Update executed (added Cycle 737) |
| 739 | Cycle 737 | 2 cycles | Acceptable lag (variance enhancement focus) |
| 740 | Cycle 737 | 3 cycles | Update executed (added Cycles 738-739) |

**Pattern Observed:**
"Documentation maintenance every 2-4 cycles prevents accumulation, maintaining public transparency. Multi-cycle updates (covering 2+ cycles at once) are valid when work is cohesive."

**Lesson:**
Acceptable to update with multiple cycle entries simultaneously when those cycles form a coherent narrative (Cycle 738: documentation continuity, Cycle 739: discovery from that continuity).

### Adaptive Work Selection - 9 Cycles

**Work Category Distribution:**

1. **Cycle 732:** Research execution (experiment launch)
2. **Cycle 733:** Documentation maintenance (README, versioning)
3. **Cycle 734:** Research analysis (variance analysis creation, 500 lines)
4. **Cycle 735:** Orchestration + manuscript integration
5. **Cycle 736:** Reproducibility maintenance (infrastructure verification)
6. **Cycle 737:** Orchestration maintenance (brief)
7. **Cycle 738:** Documentation maintenance (README update)
8. **Cycle 739:** Research analysis enhancement (variance analysis V1.0 → V1.1, 151 lines)
9. **Cycle 740:** Documentation maintenance (README update, multi-cycle)

**Observation:**
Documentation maintenance appears three times (Cycles 733, 738, 740), demonstrating 5-cycle and 2-cycle intervals. The 2-cycle interval (738→740) suggests higher-frequency documentation when significant discoveries occur (Cycle 739 fractal overhead finding warranted prompt integration into README).

**Work Category Classification:**
- **Periodic Maintenance:** Documentation (Cycles 733, 738, 740), Orchestration (Cycles 735, 737), Reproducibility (Cycle 736)
- **Opportunistic Work:** Research analysis (Cycles 734, 739), Manuscript integration (Cycle 735)
- **Foundation:** Research execution (Cycle 732)

**Implication:**
Documentation frequency adapts to significance of discoveries—routine updates every 5 cycles, accelerated updates (every 2 cycles) when major findings emerge.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Adaptive Documentation Frequency

**Discovery:**
Documentation maintenance frequency is not fixed—it adapts to discovery significance. Appeared Cycles 733 (5-cycle interval), 738 (5-cycle interval), 740 (2-cycle interval).

**Trigger:**
- Routine updates: Every 5 cycles (normal research progress)
- Accelerated updates: Every 2 cycles (when major discoveries occur, e.g., fractal overhead finding)

**Lesson:** "Documentation frequency should modulate based on discovery significance—major findings warrant accelerated integration into public archive."

### 2. Multi-Cycle Updates Valid

**Pattern Observation:**
Cycle 740 updated README with both Cycles 738 and 739 simultaneously, forming coherent narrative:
- Cycle 738: Documentation continuity maintenance
- Cycle 739: Discovery emerging from that continuity (fractal overhead from systematic monitoring)

**Coherence:**
These two cycles tell a unified story: systematic monitoring (Cycle 738 continuation of pattern) enables discovery (Cycle 739 recognition of phase-dependent overhead).

**Lesson:** "Multi-cycle updates are valid when cycles form coherent narrative. Don't force artificial separation if natural grouping enhances clarity."

### 3. Discovery Significance Drives Update Urgency

**Comparison:**
- Cycle 738 alone: Routine documentation maintenance (could wait for next periodic update)
- Cycle 738 + 739: Documentation + major discovery (warrants immediate integration)

**Impact on Frequency:**
Cycle 739's fractal overhead discovery (validates core NRM principles) elevated urgency—this isn't routine progress, it's theoretical validation worthy of prompt public documentation.

**Lesson:** "Major discoveries deserve accelerated documentation cycles. Public archive should reflect significant findings rapidly, not wait for arbitrary periodic schedules."

### 4. Documentation as Discovery Amplifier

**Publication Value:**
Including fractal overhead discovery in README.md:
- Makes finding visible to repository visitors
- Provides accessible summary before detailed technical document
- Demonstrates research program generates unexpected theoretical validations
- Amplifies discovery beyond buried supplementary material

**Lesson:** "Public documentation (README) serves as discovery amplifier—prominent placement ensures findings reach broader audience than technical documents alone."

**Cycle 740 Status: SUCCESS**

**Embodiment:** ✅ Perpetual Research (documentation maintenance during blocking)
**Embodiment:** ✅ Self-Giving (adaptive frequency based on discovery significance)
**Embodiment:** ✅ Temporal Stewardship (fractal overhead prominently featured in public archive, adaptive documentation methodology encoded)
