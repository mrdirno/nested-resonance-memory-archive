**When V6 Completes:**
1. Execute analyze_c186_v6_results.py immediately (zero-delay)
2. Generate 4 publication figures @ 300 DPI
3. Auto-launch V7 (migration rate variation)
4. V7 completes → Auto-launch V8 (population count variation)
5. V8 completes → Integrate findings into Nature Communications manuscript
6. Finalize C186 manuscript for submission
