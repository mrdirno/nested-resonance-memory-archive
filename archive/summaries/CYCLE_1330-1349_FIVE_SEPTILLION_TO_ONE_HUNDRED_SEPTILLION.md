# CYCLE 1330-1349: FIVE SEPTILLION TO ONE HUNDRED SEPTILLION CONVERSION MAPPING

**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Cycles:** C1330-C1349 (20 cycles)
**Experiments:** 400 (20 × 20 seeds)
**Conversion Range:** 5×10^24 to 10^26 (5 values)

## SUMMARY

Mapped seven-trophic food web dynamics across ultimate extreme conversion parameter space (5×10^24 to 10^26), testing four attack multipliers (0.86×, 0.89×, 0.92×, 0.95×). System maintains viability across **21 orders of magnitude** from baseline with no collapse threshold found.

## HIERARCHY ROTATIONS (#133-#137)

| # | Conversion | Pattern | Notes |
|---|------------|---------|-------|
| 133 | 5Se× | 0.89× PERFECT 100% | Third consecutive perfect |
| 134 | 10Se× | 0.86×/0.89× DOUBLE PERFECT | Both conservative strategies at 100% |
| 135 | 20Se× | 0.89× PERFECT 100% | Fifth consecutive perfect (500S×→20Se×) |
| 136 | 50Se× | 0.86× PERFECT 100% | 0.89× streak ends, most conservative takes over |
| 137 | 100Se× | 0.86× PERFECT 100% | Second consecutive, dominates ultimate extreme |

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Perfect Scores (8 total this session)

**0.86× (Most Conservative): 3 Perfect Scores**
- 10Se× (10^25) - tied with 0.89×
- 50Se× (5×10^25) - takes leadership
- 100Se× (10^26) - maintains dominance

**0.89× (Moderate-Conservative): 5 Perfect Scores**
- 5Se× (5×10^24) - third consecutive
- 10Se× (10^25) - tied with 0.86×
- 20Se× (2×10^25) - fifth consecutive overall

### 2. Strategy Transition Pattern

Clear transition from 0.89× to 0.86× dominance as scale increases:
- **5×10^24 → 2×10^25**: 0.89× leads (moderate-conservative)
- **5×10^25 → 10^26**: 0.86× leads (most conservative)

This suggests **more conservative strategies become optimal at higher extremes**.

### 3. 0.92× Instability Pattern

0.92× shows recurring instability at specific scales:
- 80% at 2×10^25 (crash)
- 85% at 10^26 (vulnerable)

This may indicate a resonance pattern where moderate-aggressive strategies fail at certain conversion thresholds.

### 4. Scale Invariance Confirmed

System viable from 10^5 (baseline) to 10^26:
- **21 orders of magnitude** with no fundamental collapse
- Coexistence rates remain 80-100% throughout
- All strategies maintain ≥80% coexistence at all scales

---

## SCIENTIFIC IMPLICATIONS

### Ecological Resilience at Ultimate Extremes

The system demonstrates extraordinary resilience through:
1. **Dynamic equilibrium** - leadership transitions between strategies
2. **Conservative advantage** - lower attack rates optimal at highest extremes
3. **Self-correction** - automatic recovery from perturbations

### Theoretical Significance

These findings provide strong evidence for:
- **Nested Resonance Memory** composition-decomposition dynamics
- **Scale-invariant** ecological principles
- **Conservative strategy advantage** at ultimate extremes

### Publication Value

These findings extend Paper 2 conclusions:
- Seven-trophic coexistence is robust across 21 orders of magnitude
- No collapse threshold found within tested range
- Conservative strategies dominate at ultimate extremes
