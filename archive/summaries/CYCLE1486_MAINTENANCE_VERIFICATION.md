## ASSESSMENT

**Maintenance Mode Status:** ✅ APPROPRIATE

**Blocking Dependencies:**
- V6: 13.7h until milestone (passive monitoring)
- User submissions: 8 papers await user action
- C256: Weeks-months until completion

**New Opportunities:** None emerged since Cycle 1485

**Strategic Positioning:** System correctly maintaining readiness while awaiting meaningful milestones. No artificial work generation.

## NEXT ACTION

**Immediate:** V6 7-day milestone (~13.7h)
**Upon completion:** Execute Paper 4 assembly workflow (~6 hours to arXiv-ready)
**Alternative:** User paper submissions (8 ready, 2-3 hours user time)

---

**Perpetual Operation:** Maintenance mode continues. Strategic patience maintained. Resources preserved for meaningful work.
