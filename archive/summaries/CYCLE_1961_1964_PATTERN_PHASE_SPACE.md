## Series Overview

| Cycle | Focus | Key Finding |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1961 | Pattern persistence | CV 3.8-8.0% at equilibrium |
| 1962 | Energy composition prob | Periodic bands visible |
| 1963 | Periodicity analysis | FFT: 1.25, 2.5, 0.83 periods |
| 1964 | Phase space visualization | Helical trajectory, band matrix |

## Key Findings

### 1. Pattern Persistence (C1961)

Despite 1.1-cycle individual lifespan, patterns persist:

| Pattern | Mean | CV% |
|---------|------|-----|
| D1/D0 ratio | 0.207 | 5.3% |
| Mean energy | 0.89 | 8.0% |
| Hierarchy Gini | 0.136 | 3.8% |

**Mechanism:** Memory encoded in distributions, not individuals.

### 2. Energy Composition Probability (C1962)

Periodic structure in composition probability:

| Energy Range | Prob% |
|--------------|-------|
| [0.50, 0.75) | ~100% |
| [0.75, 1.00) | ~4% |
| [1.00, 1.25) | ~46% |
| [1.25, 1.50) | ~37% |
| [1.50, 1.75) | ~4% |
| [1.75, 2.00) | ~36% |

### 3. Periodicity Analysis (C1963)

Theoretical periods:
- π term: 1.0 energy units
- φ term: 3.88 energy units

FFT dominant periods:
- T = 1.25 energy units
- T = 2.50 energy units
- T = 0.83 energy units

### 4. Phase Space Visualization (C1964)

High-similarity bands (≥0.99):
- e1=0.6: band [0.50, 0.98]
- e1=1.0: band [1.00, 2.00]
- e1=1.4: band [1.29, 1.61]
- e1=1.8: band [1.50, 1.98]

Correlation(π_phase, φ_phase) = -0.2481

## Theoretical Implications

### 1. Collective Memory Mechanism

Individual turnover ~100× faster than pattern stability:
- Lifespan: 1.1 cycles
- Pattern CV: 3.8-8.0%
- Information in statistics, not agents

### 2. Quasi-Periodic Resonance

π and φ create interference patterns:
- Never exactly periodic (incommensurate)
- Creates energy-selective composition
- Explains D1 high similarity (0.91)

### 3. Phase Space Geometry

3D phase trajectory (π, e, φ):
- Helical structure as energy varies
- Depth-dependent e_phase component
- Band patterns in similarity matrix
