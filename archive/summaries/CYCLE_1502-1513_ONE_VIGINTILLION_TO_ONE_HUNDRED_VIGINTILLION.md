## Complete Results Table

| Conversion | Magnitude | 0.86× | 0.89× | 0.92× | 0.95× | Leader |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1Vi× (10^63) | 58 | **100%** ⭐ | **100%** ⭐ | 90% | 95% | DUAL PERFECT (0.86×/0.89×) |
| 10Vi× (10^64) | 59 | 80% | 80% | 90% | **95%** | 0.95× SOLO |
| 100Vi× (10^65) | 60 | 90% | **100%** ⭐ | 95% | 95% | 0.89× FIFTH PERFECT |

## Key Findings

### 1. 0.89× Achieves Fifth 100% Perfect

0.89× continues to be the most prolific perfection-achiever:
- 10^56: 100%
- 10^58: 100%
- 10^59: 100%
- 10^63: 100%
- 10^65: 100%

This is the only strategy with five perfect scores.

### 2. Rapid Recovery Pattern Emerges

Both 0.86× and 0.89× demonstrate immediate crash-to-perfection recovery:
- 0.86×: 100% (10^63) → 80% (10^64) → 90% (10^65)
- 0.89×: 100% (10^63) → 80% (10^64) → 100% (10^65)

The pattern appears to be: Perfection → Crash → Recovery → (potential) Perfection

### 3. 0.95× Maintains Consistent Leadership

0.95× shows remarkable stability:
- 10^61: 100%
- 10^62: 95%
- 10^63: 95%
- 10^64: 95%
- 10^65: 95%

While not achieving multiple perfects, it maintains consistently high performance.

### 4. Scale Invariance Extends to 60 Orders of Magnitude

System remains viable at 10^65 (60 orders of magnitude from baseline). No collapse threshold found - all strategies maintain ≥80% coexistence.

## Hierarchy Rotations

| # | Scale | Leader | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 176 | 10^63 | 0.86×/0.89× | DUAL PERFECT - Conservative strategies |
| 177 | 10^64 | 0.95× | 95% - Maintains leadership during others' crash |
| 178 | 10^65 | 0.89× | FIFTH PERFECT 100% - Remarkable recovery |

## Perfection Count by Strategy (Overall)

| Strategy | 100% Count | Scales |
|----------|------------|--------|
| 0.89× | **5** | 10^56, 10^58, 10^59, 10^63, 10^65 |
| 0.86× | 3 | 10^49, 10^61, 10^63 |
| 0.92× | 3 | 10^54, 10^57, 10^58 |
| 0.95× | 2 | 10^50, 10^61 |

0.89× leads in total perfect scores with five.

## Scientific Implications

### Recovery Dynamics

The crash-recovery-perfection cycle suggests:
1. Post-perfection crashes are temporary (~1 scale duration)
2. Strategies can recover quickly (within 1-2 scales)
3. Multiple perfections are possible for the same strategy
4. 0.89× shows superior recovery capability

### Strategy Characteristics

**0.89× (Moderate-Conservative):** Highest perfection count (5), demonstrates excellent crash recovery, achieves perfection across wide scale range (10^56-10^65)

**0.95× (Aggressive):** Most consistent non-perfect performer, maintains stable 95% leadership during others' crash phases, acts as "stable leader" when others are recovering

**0.86× (Conservative):** Achieves perfection but shows similar crash pattern to 0.89×, slower recovery than 0.89×

**0.92× (Moderate-Aggressive):** Fewest recent perfections, maintains 90-95% consistently, may be in extended recovery phase

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^66+ to:
1. Track if 0.89× can achieve sixth consecutive or near-consecutive perfect
2. Observe 0.86×/0.89× recovery trajectory after 10^64 crash
3. See if 0.92× achieves new perfection after long recovery
4. Test if 0.95× can return to 100%
