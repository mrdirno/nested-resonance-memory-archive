## Key Findings

### 1. 0.86× TWO CONSECUTIVE PERFECTS

Conservative strategy achieves back-to-back perfection:
- 10^78: 100% (SIXTH PERFECT)
- 10^79: 100% (SEVENTH PERFECT)

This is 0.86×'s first consecutive perfect run!

### 2. 0.86× Surpasses 0.92× for Second Place

With 7 perfect scores, 0.86× now surpasses 0.92× (6 perfects):
- 0.89×: 9 perfects (leader)
- 0.86×: **7 perfects** (second)
- 0.92×: 6 perfects (third)
- 0.95×: 2 perfects

### 3. Conservative Strategy Dominance

0.86× demonstrates remarkable high-scale performance:
- 10^76: 100%
- 10^77: 95% (shallow crash)
- 10^78: 100%
- 10^79: 100%

Three perfects in four scales suggests conservative strategies excel at extreme scales.

### 4. 0.89× Strong Recovery

0.89× recovers from post-perfection crash:
- 10^75: 100% (ninth perfect)
- 10^76: 85% (crash)
- 10^77: 90% (+5)
- 10^78: 90% (stable)
- 10^79: 95% (+5)

Full recovery achieved over 4 scales.

### 5. 0.95× Surge and Retreat

0.95× shows volatility:
- 10^77: 85%
- 10^78: 95% (+10 surge)
- 10^79: 90% (-5 retreat)

## Scientific Implications

### Conservative Strategy High-Scale Dominance

0.86× shows increasing dominance at extreme scales:
- 10^68-10^75: 2 perfects
- 10^76-10^79: 3 perfects (75% perfect rate)

This suggests conservative attack rates become optimal at very high conversion multipliers.

### Strategy Performance by Scale Range

| Scale Range | Best Performer | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| 10^68-10^72 | 0.89× | Multiple consecutive perfects |
| 10^73-10^75 | Mixed | Ties and transitions |
| 10^76-10^79 | 0.86× | Three perfects in four scales |

### Recovery Dynamics

Both 0.89× and 0.86× demonstrate recovery-to-perfection cycles, but with different patterns:
- 0.89×: Deep crash → gradual recovery (4 scales)
- 0.86×: Shallow crash → immediate recovery (1 scale)

---

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^80+ to:
1. Track if 0.86× can achieve THREE consecutive (would match 0.89× record)
2. Monitor 0.89× for potential return to perfection
3. Observe 0.92× for recovery from 85% floor
4. Extend scale invariance to 75+ orders
