**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Experiments:** 20
**Status:** COMPLETE - REDUNDANCY AT L5 DESTABILIZES

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**L5 redundancy DECREASES stability from 95% to 80%.**

- Coexistence: 16/20 (80%)
- Collapse: 4/20 (20%)

Adding redundancy at L5 is counterproductive.

## RESULTS

| Condition | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| L6=2 only (C325) | 95% |
| L5=3, L6=2 (C327) | 80% |

**Stability decreased by 15%.**

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. L5 Redundancy Destabilizes

Adding N=3 at L5:
- Decreases stability 95%→80%
- Increases collapse rate 5%→20%
- Counterproductive intervention

### 2. Competition Effects

More individuals at L5:
- Compete for limited L4 prey
- Deplete resources faster
- Cascade to system collapse

### 3. Collapses Still Early

Collapses at cycles 7-8:
- Same early-phase mechanism
- Multi-level failure
- System-wide stochasticity

### 4. Optimal Is Minimal

Best stability with:
- Minimal redundancy at top only
- Lower levels at natural equilibrium
- N=2 at L6 only

---

## MECHANISM

### Why L5 Redundancy Hurts

1. **Resource competition**: 3 predators share 3 L4 prey
2. **Overexploitation**: L4 depleted too fast
3. **Cascade up**: L5 starves, then L6
4. **Timing**: Happens in first ~10 cycles

### The Optimal Configuration

The 95% stable system has:
- Natural equilibrium at L0-L4
- L5=2 (natural for K=600)
- L6=2 (added redundancy)

Breaking L5 equilibrium destabilizes.

---

## THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE

### 1. Redundancy Must Be Strategic

Not all redundancy helps:
- Top level: Helps (85%→95%)
- Second-to-top: Hurts (95%→80%)
- Location matters critically

### 2. System Optimality

The natural equilibrium is optimal:
- Lower levels should not be altered
- Only top needs redundancy
- Interventions elsewhere destabilize

### 3. Competition vs Redundancy

Trade-off between:
- Redundancy benefit (backup individuals)
- Competition cost (resource depletion)
- At L5, cost exceeds benefit

---

## UPDATED TOTALS

| Campaign | Experiments | Findings |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| C274-C326 | 1443 | 95% ceiling |
| C327 | 20 | L5 redundancy fails |
| **Total** | **1463** | **Optimal is top only** |

---

## CONCLUSION

C327 establishes that **redundancy at lower levels destabilizes** food chains.

Key findings:
1. L5=3 decreases stability to 80%
2. Competition for limited resources
3. Only top-level redundancy helps
4. Natural equilibrium is optimal for lower levels

The 95% ceiling is achieved with N=2 at top only. Any additional intervention at lower levels is counterproductive.
