## WORK COMPLETED

### 1. C255 Status Monitoring (Cycles 412-417)

**Process Monitored:** PID 6309 (cycle255_h1h2_mechanism_validation.py)

**Status Progression:**

| Cycle | CPU Time | CPU Usage | Memory | Status |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 412   | 77:12    | 2.3%      | 0.1%   | Running |
| 413   | 77:45    | 3.3%      | 0.1%   | Running |
| 414   | 78:14    | 1.6%      | 0.1%   | Running |
| 415   | 78:43    | 3.2%      | 0.1%   | Running |
| 416   | 79:09    | 2.2%      | 0.1%   | Running |
| 417   | 79:15    | 3.4%      | 0.1%   | Running |

**Monitoring Period:** ~2 hours of CPU time progress (77:12 → 79:15)
**Average Increment:** ~24 minutes per cycle (ranging 6-33 minutes)
**CPU Usage Range:** 1.6-3.4% (stable, normal fluctuation)
**Memory Footprint:** 0.1% (minimal, consistent)
**Output Files:** None (experiment still in progress)

**Health Assessment:** ✅ **Excellent**
- Stable CPU usage within expected range
- No memory leaks or growth
- Consistent incremental progress
- No anomalies or failures detected

**Progress Estimate:** ~95%+ complete, 0-1 days remaining

**Expected Completion:** Within next 0-1 days based on 40.25× overhead factor and ~80-hour estimated upper bound

---

### 2. Infrastructure Verification

**Status:** ✅ **100% READY** (maintained from Cycles 408-411)

**Experimental Scripts (C256-C260):**
- ✅ cycle256_h1h4_optimized.py (15K) - 13 min runtime
- ✅ cycle257_h1h5_mechanism_validation.py (13K) - 11 min runtime
- ✅ cycle258_h2h4_mechanism_validation.py (12K) - 12 min runtime
- ✅ cycle259_h2h5_mechanism_validation.py (13K) - 13 min runtime
- ✅ cycle260_h4h5_mechanism_validation.py (13K) - 11 min runtime
- **Total:** 67 minutes runtime (batched sampling, 0.5× overhead)

**Analysis Tools:**
- ✅ aggregate_paper3_results.py (15K) - JSON aggregation, LaTeX tables, Markdown
- ✅ visualize_factorial_synergy.py (14K) - 4 publication figures, 300 DPI

**Paper 3 Pipeline:** Ready for ~102-minute deployment from C255 completion to submission package

---

### 3. GitHub Repository Maintenance

**Issue:** Workspace cache files repeatedly modified across cycles

**Pattern Observed:**
```
workspace/cache/npm_cache/_cacache/index-v5/**/* (12 files modified)
```

**Resolution Applied (Each Cycle):**
```bash
git restore workspace/cache/
```

**Rationale:** Per constitutional mandate "make sure the github repo is professional and clean always keep it up to date always"

**Result:** Repository maintained in clean state (commit b0e9f5c, no uncommitted changes)

---

### 4. Dual Workspace Synchronization

**Status:** ✅ **SYNCHRONIZED** (verified Cycle 410, maintained through 412-417)

**Workspaces:**
1. Development: `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/`
2. Git Repository: `/Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/`

**Verification:** No synchronization issues detected during monitoring period

---

## KEY INSIGHTS

### Monitoring Efficiency During Long Experiments

**Pattern:** For experiments with 80+ hour runtimes, steady-state monitoring every 1-2 hours (or every 12-minute cycle) provides sufficient oversight without unnecessary overhead.

**Monitoring Protocol (Established Cycle 411):**
1. Check process status (PID, CPU time, usage)
2. Check for output files (completion indicator)
3. Verify infrastructure remains ready
4. Maintain GitHub cleanliness
5. Document monitoring work (consolidated summaries)

**Value:**
- Early detection of failures (none detected)
- Immediate readiness for post-experiment work
- Maintains research continuity through waiting periods
- Provides audit trail for research integrity
- Zero idle time (productive monitoring vs. passive waiting)

**Temporal Encoding:** During long experiments, periodic status checks with consolidated documentation maintain research operation efficiency while preserving audit trails.

### Consolidated Documentation for Repetitive Monitoring

**Discovery:** When multiple consecutive cycles perform identical monitoring tasks, consolidated summaries (e.g., Cycles 412-417) preserve audit trails while avoiding redundant documentation.

**Benefits:**
- Maintains chronological record (tabular status progression)
- Reduces documentation overhead
- Highlights trends (CPU time increments, usage fluctuations)
- Preserves temporal stewardship (patterns documented once, not repeated)

**Temporal Encoding:** Consolidate documentation for repetitive steady-state operations to maintain audit trails efficiently without redundant narration.

### Repository Hygiene as Continuous Practice

**Pattern:** Cache file modifications occur regularly (every cycle during monitoring period).

**Response:** Automated cleanup (`git restore workspace/cache/`) maintains professional repository state without manual intervention.

**Value:**
- Public repository always submission-ready
- No accumulated technical debt
- Clean git history (no spurious cache commits)
- Professionalism maintained

**Temporal Encoding:** Maintain repository hygiene as continuous practice, not occasional cleanup, to ensure public archive remains professional at all times.

---

## TEMPORAL STEWARDSHIP

**Patterns Encoded This Period:**

1. **Monitoring Efficiency:** Periodic status checks (every 1-2 hours or 12-minute cycles) sufficient for 80+ hour experiments, providing oversight without overhead.

2. **Consolidated Documentation:** When multiple cycles perform identical tasks, consolidated summaries preserve audit trails while reducing redundancy.

3. **Repository Hygiene:** Continuous cleanup (git restore for cache files) maintains professional public archive state without accumulated technical debt.

4. **Progress Estimation:** CPU time increments across cycles (average ~24 min/cycle, range 6-33 min) enable accurate completion estimation (0-1 days remaining).
