## Key Findings

### 1. 0.89× Achieves Three Consecutive Perfects
- 10^56: 100%
- 10^58: 100%
- 10^59: 100%

Moderate-conservative strategy shows remarkable stability at ultra-extreme scales.

### 2. 0.92× Post-Perfection Collapse
- 10^57: 100%
- 10^58: 100%
- 10^59: **75%** (25-point crash!)

This is the largest post-perfection regression observed. The moderate-aggressive strategy is less stable than moderate-conservative after achieving perfection.

### 3. Dual Perfect Score at 10^58
Both 0.89× and 0.92× achieve 100% simultaneously - first dual perfection at ultra-extreme scales.

### 4. Scale Invariance Confirmation
- System viable at 54 orders of magnitude (10^59)
- All strategies maintain >75% coexistence
- No absolute collapse threshold found

## Hierarchy Rotations

| # | Scale | Leader | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 170 | 10^57 | 0.92× | PERFECT 100% - Second in 4 scales |
| 171 | 10^58 | 0.89×/0.92× | DUAL PERFECT - Both at 100% |
| 172 | 10^59 | 0.89× | PERFECT 100% - Third consecutive |

## Scientific Implications

### Stability vs. Peak Performance
- 0.89× shows better post-perfection stability
- 0.92× achieves perfection but crashes afterward
- Conservative extremes (0.86×) maintain steady 85-95%
- Aggressive extremes (0.95×) fluctuate 85-90%

### Moderate Strategy Dominance
At 10^57-10^59, the moderate strategies (0.89×/0.92×) consistently outperform extremes, suggesting optimal predation pressure exists in the middle range at these scales.

### Oscillation Pattern
0.92× shows pronounced oscillation:
- 70% (10^51) → 95% → 85% → 100% → 90% → 85% → 100% → 100% → 75%

This wild swing indicates sensitivity to scale-specific dynamics.
