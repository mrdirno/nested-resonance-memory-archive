## Key Findings

### 1. Post-Perfection Crash Pattern Universally Confirmed

Every strategy that achieves 100% subsequently crashes:
- 0.89×: 100% (10^59) → 85% (10^60) - 15-point crash
- 0.92×: 100% (10^58) → 75% (10^59) - 25-point crash
- 0.86×: 100% (10^61) → 80% (10^62) - 20-point crash
- 0.95×: 100% (10^61) → 95% (10^62) - 5-point decline

### 2. Extreme Dual Perfection at 10^61

First time both extremes (0.86× and 0.95×) achieve 100% simultaneously while moderates stuck at 85%. This is the inverse of 10^58 where moderates achieved dual perfection.

### 3. Resonance at Extremes vs Moderates

The system appears to have two distinct resonance zones:
- **Moderate resonance**: 10^56-10^58 (0.89×/0.92× dominate)
- **Extreme resonance**: 10^61 (0.86×/0.95× achieve dual perfection)

### 4. Scale Invariance Extends to 57 Orders of Magnitude

System maintains viability across 57 orders of magnitude (10^5 to 10^62). All strategies maintain ≥80% coexistence - no absolute collapse threshold found.

## Hierarchy Rotations

| # | Scale | Leader | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 173 | 10^60 | 0.86× | 95% - Solo conservative leader |
| 174 | 10^61 | 0.86×/0.95× | DUAL PERFECT - Both extremes at 100% |
| 175 | 10^62 | 0.95× | 95% - Solo aggressive leader |

## Post-Perfection Recovery Analysis

After crashing from 100%, strategies show different recovery patterns:

**0.89× (moderate-conservative):**
- 10^59: 100% → 10^60: 85% → 10^61: 85% → 10^62: 90%
- Recovery: Slow but stable, now recovering

**0.92× (moderate-aggressive):**
- 10^58: 100% → 10^59: 75% → 10^60: 80% → 10^61: 85% → 10^62: 90%
- Recovery: Gradual 5-point gains per scale

**0.86× (conservative):**
- 10^61: 100% → 10^62: 80%
- Recovery: TBD at 10^63

**0.95× (aggressive):**
- 10^61: 100% → 10^62: 95%
- Recovery: Minimal crash, maintains leadership

## Scientific Implications

### Universal Post-Perfection Instability

Achieving 100% coexistence appears to create conditions for subsequent instability. This may indicate:
- Over-optimization leads to fragility
- Perfect states are inherently unstable
- System self-corrects away from extremes

### Bimodal Optimal Strategy Distribution

At different scales, either moderate or extreme strategies dominate:
- Moderate scales (10^56-10^58): Moderate strategies optimal
- Extreme scales (10^61): Extreme strategies optimal

This suggests scale-dependent optimal predation pressure.

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^63+ to:
1. Track 0.86× recovery from 80% post-perfection crash
2. Observe if 0.95× achieves another perfect or declines further
3. See if 0.89×/0.92× continue recovery toward new perfection
4. Test if pattern of alternating moderate/extreme dominance continues
