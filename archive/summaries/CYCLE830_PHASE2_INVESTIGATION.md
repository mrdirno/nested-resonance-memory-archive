## Context: Session Continuation

This session continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. A detailed summary was provided showing Cycle 823 work:

**Cycle 823 Achievements:**
- ✅ PC001 implementation (NRM Population Dynamics)
- ✅ PC002 implementation (Regime Detection in Population Dynamics)
- ✅ TEG integration (PC001+PC002 demo)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (principle_cards/README.md, 827 lines)
- ✅ All work committed and pushed to GitHub (6 commits)
- ✅ 41/41 PC002 tests passing, 100% self-test accuracy

**Meta-Orchestration Directive (Cycles 829-830):**
> "If you concluded work is done, you failed. Continue meaningful work, if you're blocked bc of awaiting results then you did not complete meaningful work. find something meaningful to do."

**Explicit Mandate:**
- Never declare "done" or "complete"
- Maintain professional, clean GitHub repository
- Keep all documentation current and synchronized
- Summaries belong in archive/summaries/
- Perpetual autonomous research

## Activity 1: V2 Workspace Synchronization Check

### Objective
Verify that newer files found in `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/code/regime/` are synchronized with main GitHub repository.

### Files Identified (Oct 31, 2025)
```
/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/code/regime/
├── regime_detector.py (19K, Oct 31 23:04)
├── validation_dataset_builder.py (14K, Oct 31 23:00)
├── cross_validation_test.py (9.3K, Oct 31 23:02)
├── debug_classification.py (4.5K, Oct 31 23:04)
└── validation_dataset.json (6.8K, Oct 31 23:00)
```

### Analysis

**Regime Detection Library (Cycle 815, Gate 1.2):**
- 8 NRM system regime types (BISTABILITY, ACCUMULATION, COLLAPSE, INITIALIZATION, STEADY_STATE, etc.)
- 17 statistical features (population dynamics, resonance dynamics, phase space, temporal context)
- Rule-based threshold matching (not ML-based like PC002)
- LOOCV validation on 8 hand-crafted samples from Papers 2, 6B, 7, Cycles 810-813
- **Target:** 90% cross-validated accuracy (Gate 1.2)
- **Achievement:** 100% accuracy (Gate 1.2 VALIDATED)

**Comparison with PC002:**
| Aspect | Gate 1.2 Regime Detector | PC002 Regime Detection |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Scope** | 8 NRM system regimes | 4 population dynamics regimes |
| **Features** | 17 multi-domain features | 4 population-focused features |
| **Approach** | Rule-based thresholds | RandomForest supervised learning |
| **Data** | Empirical experiment results | Synthetic population dynamics |
| **Purpose** | Gate 1.2 validation (Phase 1) | TSF Principle Card (Phase 2) |
| **Validation** | 100% LOOCV on 8 samples | 100% accuracy on 400 synthetic samples |

**Key Insight:** These are complementary implementations serving different purposes. Gate 1.2 library targets broader NRM system states, while PC002 focuses on compositional population dynamics for TSF framework.

### Synchronization Status

**Verification:**
```bash
$ diff /Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/code/regime/regime_detector.py \
       /Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/code/regime/regime_detector.py
# No output - files identical

$ git log --oneline -5 -- code/regime/
bf654be Cycle 815: Gate 1.2 VALIDATED - 100% cross-validated accuracy achieved
c0165a4 Cycle 815: Add validation dataset builder and ground-truth dataset for Gate 1.2
22e86f2 Cycle 815: Start Gate 1.2 - Regime Detection Library (initial implementation)
```

**Result:** ✅ **All files already synchronized and committed to GitHub (Cycle 815)**

## Activity 2: Phase Status Review

### Phase 1 Completion Report

Read `/Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/docs/PHASE1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` (Date: 2025-11-01).

**Status:** ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE - ALL 4 GATES VALIDATED (100%)**

**Gate Results:**
- ✅ **Gate 1.1 (SDE/Fokker-Planck):** 7.18% CV prediction error (±10% criterion) - PASSING
- ✅ **Gate 1.2 (Regime Detection):** 100% cross-validated accuracy (≥90% criterion) - PASSING
- ✅ **Gate 1.3 (ARBITER CI):** Hash-based reproducibility operational - PASSING
- ✅ **Gate 1.4 (Overhead Auth):** 0.12% error on C255 (±5% criterion) - PASSING

- 1,853 lines production code (4 frameworks)
- 79 comprehensive tests (100% passing)
- 4 CI/CD integration jobs
- World-class reproducibility: 9.3/10 (externally audited)

### Phase 2 Roadmap

Read `/Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/docs/STEWARDSHIP_HELIOS_ARC_ROADMAP.md`.

**Phase 2 (TSF Science Engine) Status:** Conceptual design, Gates define path

**Exit Gates:**
- **Gate 2.1:** Core API Definition (`tsf.observe|discover|refute|quantify|publish`)
- **Gate 2.2:** Orthogonal Domain Validation (2-3 external domains with refutation survival)
- **Gate 2.3:** Principle Card (PC) Formalization ⏳ **PROGRESS** (PC001+PC002 created in Cycle 823)
- **Gate 2.4:** Temporal Embedding Graph (TEG) public ⏳ **PROGRESS** (TEG implemented in Cycle 823)
- **Gate 2.5:** Material Validation Mandate (Workshop-to-Wave pipeline)

**Immediate Phase 2 Actions** (from PHASE1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md):
1. **Apply Phase 1 Frameworks to C175 Real Data** ← This was identified as highest-leverage action
2. Create Phase 2 Roadmap
3. Begin PC1: NRM Population Dynamics
4. Manuscript Preparation (Paper 8)

**Key Finding:** Cycle 823 work (PC001, PC002, TEG) already represents significant Phase 2 progress toward Gates 2.3 and 2.4.

---

## Activity 3: PC002 C175 Validation Attempt

### Objective
Apply PC002 (Regime Detection) to real C175 consolidation experiment data to demonstrate compositional Principle Card framework on actual population dynamics.

**Expected Outcome:** Validate PC002 against real experimental data, compare with Gate 1.2 results, generate publishable Phase 2 findings.

### Implementation

**File Created:** `principle_cards/pc002_c175_validation.py` (429 lines)

**Approach:**
1. Load C175 experimental data from `data/results/nrmv2_c175_consolidation.json`
2. Extract population timeseries
3. Create PC001 baseline from C175 parameters
4. Set PC002 baseline (enforce compositional dependency: PC002 depends on PC001)
5. Generate sliding windows from population timeseries
6. Extract features for each window
7. Classify regimes using PC002
8. Compare with Gate 1.2 regime detection results
9. Save validation results with provenance

### Discovered Limitation

**C175 Consolidation Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "agents": [0, 1, 2, ..., 29],  // 30 agents
  "metadata": {...},
  "patterns": {...},
  "statistics": {
    "final_coherence": 0.683,
    "num_patterns": 3,
    "compression_ratio": 36.7,
    "mean_coalition_coherence": 0.973,
    "consolidated_fraction": 1.0
  },
  "timeseries": {
    "mean_phase": [...],
    "order_parameter": [...],
    "time": [...]
  },
  "validation": {...}
}
```

**Problem:** No population timeseries available. The C175 consolidation data focuses on memory consolidation patterns (phase dynamics, order parameters) rather than raw population dynamics.

**Gate 1 Validation Results** (file: `gate1_validation_c175_20251101_004658.json`):
```json
{
  "gate_1_1": {
    "observed_mean": 104.735,
    "observed_std": 12.075756476194847,
    "observed_cv": 0.11529819521835917,
    ...
  },
  "gate_1_2": {
    "features": {
      "mean_population": 98.587,
      "cv_population": 0.12069126207529218,
      "persistence_rate": 1.0,
      "extinction": "False"
    },
    "predicted_regime": "healthy",
    "gate_1_2_pass": true
  },
  ...
}
```

**Analysis:** Gate 1 validation computed statistics from some C175 data source, but the consolidation JSON doesn't contain the underlying population timeseries.

### Execution Results

```
$ python principle_cards/pc002_c175_validation.py

```

**Result:** ❌ Validation script cannot execute due to missing population timeseries in C175 consolidation data.

## Key Findings

### 1. V2 Workspace Already Synchronized ✅
Gate 1.2 regime detection library (Cycle 815) is already committed and synchronized to GitHub. No additional synchronization needed.

### 2. Phase 2 Progress Already Significant ✅
Cycle 823 PC001+PC002+TEG work represents substantial progress toward:
- **Gate 2.3 (PC Formalization):** Complete PrincipleCard base class, PC001, PC002 implemented with full validation
- **Gate 2.4 (TEG):** TemporalEmbeddingGraph class implemented with dependency tracking, validation ordering, cycle detection, serialization

### 3. Data Archiving Gap Identified ⚠️

**Issue:** C175 consolidation data contains pattern analysis results but lacks raw population timeseries needed for PC002 validation.

**Impact:**
- Cannot validate PC002 on real experimental data
- Cannot demonstrate PC001→PC002 compositional validation on real population dynamics
- Cannot generate novel publishable Phase 2 findings from C175 data

**Root Cause:** Experimental data archiving focused on final consolidated patterns rather than intermediate population dynamics.

**Implications for Phase 2:**
- Need systematic data archiving protocol for Principle Card validation
- Raw timeseries data must be preserved alongside summary statistics
- TSF framework requires access to complete observational sequences for regime classification

### 4. PC002 vs. Gate 1.2: Complementary Implementations ✅

**Key Insight:** PC002 and Gate 1.2 regime detector serve different purposes in the framework:

| Purpose | Implementation | Scope |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Phase 1 Gate Validation** | Gate 1.2 (rule-based, 8 regimes, 17 features) | Validate NRM Reference Instrument |
| **Phase 2 TSF Framework** | PC002 (ML-based, 4 regimes, 4 features, compositional) | Demonstrate Principle Card composition |

Both implementations achieved 100% accuracy on their respective validation sets. They are complementary, not redundant.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Cycle 831+)

1. **Data Archiving Protocol**
   - Create systematic data preservation requirements for Phase 2 PC validation
   - Raw timeseries must be archived alongside summary statistics
   - Document required data structure for each PC validation

2. **C175 Raw Data Recovery** (if possible)
   - Search for original C175 experiment output files
   - Check if population timeseries available in other formats
   - If not available, document as lesson learned for future experiments

3. **PC002 Validation Strategy Update**
   - If C175 raw data unavailable, pivot to validating PC002 on:
     - C171 data (accumulation regime)
     - C176 data (collapse regime)
     - C168-170 data (bistability regime)
   - Or generate synthetic validation dataset from known parameters

4. **Phase 2 Progress Documentation**
   - Create `docs/PHASE2_PROGRESS_REPORT.md` documenting:
     - Gates 2.3 and 2.4 progress from Cycle 823
     - PC001+PC002 compositional validation framework
     - TEG implementation and capabilities
     - Next steps toward remaining gates

### Medium-Term (Phase 2)

5. **Systematic PC Development**
   - Continue PC003-PC006 development per Phase 2 roadmap
   - Each PC should specify required data structure for validation
   - Build validation dataset alongside PC implementation

6. **TSF Core API Design** (Gate 2.1)
   - Design `tsf.observe|discover|refute|quantify|publish` API
   - Base on Cycle 823 PC/TEG implementation patterns
   - Integrate with existing Phase 1 frameworks (Gates 1.1-1.4)

7. **Material Validation Pipeline** (Gate 2.5)
   - Begin designing "Workshop-to-Wave" pipeline
   - Identify first PC candidate for physical validation
   - Establish bench-scale testbed requirements
