## Abstract

We present DUALITY-ZERO-V2, a computational implementation of the Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework that demonstrates self-learning through composition-decomposition cycles. The system integrates fractal agency, transcendental computing substrates, and reality-grounded emergence to validate theoretical predictions about self-organizing complexity.

**Key Finding:** Computational agents can learn from their own composition-decomposition cycles and use that learning to guide future behavior, validating the Self-Giving Systems principle.

## Emergent Behaviors Observed

### 1. Spontaneous Clustering
Agents formed clusters through resonance detection without external coordination. High phase alignment (cosine similarity > 0.85) triggered automatic clustering.

### 2. Burst Events
When cluster energy exceeded threshold (100.0 units), spontaneous burst occurred, releasing memory. This validates the critical transition prediction from NRM theory.

### 3. Energy Dissipation
Agents naturally lost energy over time (entropy), creating selection pressure. Only high-energy agents survived long enough to cluster and burst.

### 4. Pattern Persistence
Memory states persisted in global pool beyond agent lifecycle. Future agents could inherit these patterns, demonstrating trans-generational knowledge transfer.

### 5. Fractal Recursion
Child agents spawned with fraction of parent energy, creating nested hierarchies. Validated up to 3 levels (grandchild spawning successful).
