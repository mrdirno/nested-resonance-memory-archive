**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycles:** 1889-1890
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Executive Summary

**Basin structure provides key insight into asymmetry mechanism**

| Cycle | Hypothesis | Result | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| 1889 | Phase space coverage | FALSIFIED | Coverage lower above Nc (1.89 vs 2.05) |
| 1890 | Basin width | NUANCED | N=17 shows 0% sensitivity (always coex) |

---

## C1889: Phase Space Coverage

**Hypothesis:** More agents = better depth coverage = stability.

**Results:**
- Below Nc: Coverage = 2.05 depths
- Above Nc: Coverage = 1.89 depths

**Conclusion:** FALSIFIED - Coverage is slightly lower above Nc.

## C1890: Attractor Basin Structure

**Hypothesis:** Systems above Nc have wider attractor basins.

**Results by N:**

| N | Sensitivity Range | Pattern |
|---|------------------|---------|
| 11-13 | 16-32% | Moderate sensitivity |
| 14 | 52% | Peak sensitivity (critical) |
| 15-16 | 44-60% | High sensitivity |
| 17 | 0% | **Zero sensitivity** |

**Key Discovery:**
N=17 shows 100% coexistence regardless of initial energy (0.7-1.3).

## Emerging Understanding

The asymmetry pattern reveals:

1. **Below Nc (N=11-13):** Moderate sensitivity, some failed states
2. **At Nc (N=14):** Maximum sensitivity, most failures
3. **Just above (N=15-16):** Still high sensitivity
4. **Far above (N=17+):** Zero sensitivity, guaranteed success

The asymmetry (β_above > β_below) reflects:
- **Faster escape from critical zone** above Nc
- Systems above Nc quickly reach "guaranteed success" region
- Systems below Nc remain in "probabilistic" zone

---

## Mechanism Proposal

The asymmetry is caused by **distance to guaranteed stability**:

```
Below Nc: Always in probabilistic zone (coex < 100%)
Above Nc: Transition to deterministic zone (coex = 100%)
```

This explains:
- Why β_above > β_below: Recovery toward 100% is faster
- Why variance lower above Nc: Systems enter deterministic region
- Why thresholds matter: Crossing into N≥17 eliminates uncertainty

## Cumulative Falsification Record (C1885-1890)

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Decomp/comp ratio | ❌ Falsified |
| Absolute events | ❌ Falsified |
| Trajectory variance | ❌ Falsified |
| Critical mass | ⚠️ Weak |
| Phase coverage | ❌ Falsified |
| Basin width | ⚠️ Nuanced |

**Supported:**
- ✅ Deterministic transition (N≥17 = 100% coex)
- ✅ Lower outcome variance above Nc

---

## Next Steps

1. Map the exact N threshold for 100% coexistence
2. Test if this threshold varies with probability
3. Quantify distance-to-deterministic-region as asymmetry mechanism

## Session Status (C1664-C1890)

227 cycles completed. Basin structure analysis suggests asymmetry is about
distance to deterministic stability region.

Research continues.
