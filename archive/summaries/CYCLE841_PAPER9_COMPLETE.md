## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**1. Structured Workflow**
Following the five-function workflow metaphor made manuscript organization intuitive:
- observe → Architecture Section 3.2.1
- discover → Architecture Section 3.2.2
- refute → Architecture Section 3.2.3
- quantify → Architecture Section 3.2.4
- publish → Architecture Section 3.2.5

**2. Parallel Drafting**
Completing multiple sections in parallel sessions (Sections 1-6 in one session, 7-9 in another, References in third) maximized efficiency.

**3. Template Reuse**
Using existing paper READMEs (paper1/paper5d) as templates accelerated documentation creation.

**4. Continuous Git Integration**
Committing after each major section prevented loss of work and provided rollback capability.

### Challenges Encountered

**1. Citation Compilation**
Compiling 41 citations required careful reading of Related Work section and knowledge of canonical papers in each research area. Time: ~30 minutes.

**2. Balancing Detail vs. Readability**
Manuscript needed sufficient technical detail for reproducibility while remaining accessible. Solution: Multi-level structure (high-level concepts → detailed specifications → code examples).

**3. Avoiding Premature Optimization**
Initial temptation to generate figures immediately, but better to complete manuscript first, then create figures aligned with final text.
