## Detailed Accomplishments

### 1. arXiv Ancillary File Creation (f383391)

**Problem:** Papers 1 and 5D arXiv submission READMEs specified uploading `minimal_package_with_experiments.zip` as ancillary file, but ZIP didn't exist.

**Solution:**
```bash
cd /Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/papers
zip -r minimal_package_with_experiments.zip minimal_package_with_experiments/ \
  -x "*.pyc" -x "__pycache__/*" -x ".DS_Store"
```

**Created:**
- `papers/minimal_package_with_experiments.zip` (15K, 19 files)
- Copied to `papers/arxiv_submissions/paper1/`
- Copied to `papers/arxiv_submissions/paper5d/`

**Contents:** Dependency-free reproduction package with core modules and experiments

**Impact:** Papers 1 and 5D now have complete arXiv submission packages ready for upload

## Lessons Learned

### Effective Strategies

1. **WebSearch for real-time verification:**
   - Found 2024-2025 publications that wouldn't be in training data
   - Verified current institutional affiliations
   - Confirmed email addresses

2. **WebFetch for personal pages:**
   - Extracted contact info not in search results
   - Found institutional moves (Oettershagen: KTH → Liverpool)
   - Verified research focus alignment

3. **Diverse search queries:**
   - Started broad ("complex systems researcher 2024")
   - Narrowed to specific researchers
   - Verified emails with institutional patterns

4. **Following the Paper 1 template:**
   - Established format worked well for Papers 2 & 5D
   - Consistent structure enables comparison
   - Professional presentation

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Email availability:**
   - Some researchers don't list public emails
   - Solved: Used WebFetch on personal pages, institutional patterns

2. **Institutional moves:**
   - Lutz Oettershagen moved KTH → Liverpool
   - Solved: WebFetch on personal website revealed current affiliation

3. **Binghamton institutional overlap:**
   - Sayama & Gershenson both at Binghamton
   - Solved: Documented, noted different departments, suggested journal pick one if needed

4. **Finding 2024-2025 publications:**
   - Some fields move slower than others
   - Solved: Accepted very recent 2023 if highly relevant, prioritized 2024

## Continuation Notes

### Immediate Next Steps (User Decision Required)

**Papers 1, 2, 5D are ready for submission. User should:**

1. **Submit to arXiv:**
   - Paper 1: Upload manuscript.tex + figures + ancillary ZIP
   - Paper 5D: Upload manuscript.tex + figures + ancillary ZIP
   - Category selections already documented in arXiv README files

2. **Wait for arXiv IDs** (~1-2 days)

3. **Submit to journals:**
   - Paper 1 → PLOS Computational Biology
   - Paper 2 → PLOS ONE
   - Paper 5D → PLOS ONE (primary) or IEEE TETCI
   - Use reviewer suggestions in cover letters

### Papers 3 & 4 (Awaiting C255-C260)

**Status:** C255 not running anymore (checked ps aux, no results found)

**Options:**
1. Re-run C255 if needed
2. Check if C255 completed and results exist elsewhere
3. Proceed with Paper 5 series (5A-5F) which are script-ready

### Infrastructure Maintenance

**Reproducibility (9.3/10 maintained):**
- ✅ requirements.txt (frozen dependencies)
- ✅ Dockerfile (container specification)
- ✅ Makefile (automation targets)
- ✅ CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ CITATION.cff (metadata)
- ✅ Per-paper READMEs (Papers 1, 2, 5D)

**Documentation:**
- ✅ README.md updated (Cycle 471)
- ✅ SUBMISSION_TRACKING.md current
- ✅ All reviewer docs complete

**No infrastructure gaps identified.**
