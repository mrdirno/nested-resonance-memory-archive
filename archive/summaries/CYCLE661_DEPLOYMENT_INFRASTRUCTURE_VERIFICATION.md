## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Deployment Workflow (Ready to Execute)

**Step 1: Deploy Fix**
```bash
cd /Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/code/experiments
bash deploy_cached_metrics_fix.sh
```
- Applies FractalAgent.evolve() signature fix
- Runs validation tests (4 tests)
- Updates C256-C260 optimized scripts
- Runs smoke test (100 cycles, ~2 min)

**Step 2: Verify Fix**
```bash
cd /Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive
make verify-cached-fix
```
- Confirms cached_metrics parameter in FractalAgent.evolve()
- Validates deployment successful

**Step 3: Run Validation Tests**
```bash
make test-cached-metrics
```
- 4 dedicated tests for cached_metrics functionality
- Confirms fix doesn't break existing functionality

**Step 4: Update Scripts**
```bash
cd /Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/code/experiments
bash update_optimized_scripts.sh
```
- Propagates fix to all optimized scripts (C257-C260)
- Ensures no future TypeError crashes

**Total Time:** ~15 minutes (deployment → verification → testing → update)

## PATTERNS OBSERVED

### Pattern 1: Proactive Infrastructure Verification
- **Observation:** Verifying deployment readiness before blocking task completes
- **Rationale:** Minimize delay between C256 completion and C257-C260 launch
- **Previous Examples:**
  - Cycle 653: Deployment infrastructure verification during C256 blocking
  - Cycle 661: Re-verification as C256 approaches completion
- **Benefit:** Zero-delay deployment workflow execution

### Pattern 2: Infrastructure Excellence During Blocking
- **Duration:** 26 consecutive cycles (Cycles 636-661)
- **C256 Runtime:** 29+ hours (baseline: 20.1h, +44.4% over estimate)
- **Work Distribution:**
  - Documentation: 10 cycles (README, META_OBJECTIVES, versioning)
  - Infrastructure verification: 3 cycles (tests, deployment, reproducibility)
  - Deployment readiness: 6 cycles (scripts, tests, Makefile)
  - Gap closure: 1 cycle
  - Consolidation: 3 cycles
  - Other meaningful work: 3 cycles
- **Result:** 26 cycles productive work, 0 idle time

### Pattern 3: Test Suite As Deployment Gate
- **Observation:** make test-quick passing confirms system stability
- **Purpose:** Deployment readiness signal (green = safe to deploy)
- **Value:** Prevents deploying fix into broken state
- **Pattern:** Always verify tests before major changes

### Pattern 4: Deployment Infrastructure Prepared During Blocking
- **Timeline:**
  - Cycles 636-646: Built deployment infrastructure
  - Cycle 653: Initial verification
  - Cycle 661: Re-verification before deployment
- **Result:** Zero implementation time when C256 completes
- **Value:** Blocking time converted to preparation time

- ✅ Workflow documented (~15 min execution time)
- ✅ C256 monitoring continued (29:02.03h CPU, approaching completion)
- ✅ Zero-delay deployment workflow possible
- ✅ Infrastructure excellence pattern extended to 26 consecutive cycles
