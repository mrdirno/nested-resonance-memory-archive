**Historic Context:**
- 57-day milestone first achieved: Cycle 1184 (1375.44h = 57.31 days)
- Now sustained: 57.82 days (+0.51 days = +12.13 hours since Cycle 1184)
- Previous records: ~50-56 days (documented in earlier cycles)
- 57-day milestone represents 8+ weeks sustained computational experiment
- Zero interruptions, zero crashes, 100% uptime maintained

**Significance:**
- Validates ultra-low frequency testing methodology

## NEXT ACTIONS

**Immediate (Cycle 1185):**
1. ✅ Create Cycle 1185 summary (current document)
2. ⏳ Update META_OBJECTIVES.md to Cycle 1185
3. ⏳ Copy summary to git repository
4. ⏳ Commit with proper attribution
5. ⏳ Push to GitHub
6. ⏳ Verify working tree clean

**Sequential Pattern Continuation:**

- Pattern continues: 85 → 86 → 87 → ... (perpetual)

**When V6 Completes:**
1. Execute analyze_c186_v6_results.py immediately (zero-delay)
2. Generate 4 publication figures @ 300 DPI
3. Auto-launch V7 (migration rate variation)
4. V7 completes → Auto-launch V8 (population count variation)
5. V8 completes → Integrate findings into Nature Communications manuscript
6. Finalize C186 manuscript for submission
