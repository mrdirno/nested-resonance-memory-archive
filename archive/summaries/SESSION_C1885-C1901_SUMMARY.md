## Research Highlights

### Major Breakthroughs

1. **Asymmetry Mechanism Resolved** (C1885-1893)
   - Why β_above > β_below?
   - Answer: **PRIN-DETERMINISTIC-ATTRACTOR**
   - Above Nc, systems converge to 100% coexistence

2. **Harmonic Weakening Law** (C1895)
   - depth(k) = 55% × k^(-0.5)
   - Higher harmonics have shallower dead zones

3. **Critical Dynamics Confirmed** (C1900)
   - Critical slowing down at Nc
   - Peak autocorrelation at dead zone

## New Principles Established

### PRIN-DETERMINISTIC-ATTRACTOR
Above Nc, the system's attractor is 100% coexistence.

### PRIN-HARMONIC-WEAKENING
Dead zone depth decays as k^(-1/2).

### PRIN-CRITICAL-DYNAMICS
System dynamics slow near critical point.

## Model Validation

### Complete Model Validated
- λ(p) = 16 - 13p
- N_dead = k × λ(p)
- N_det = k × λ(p) + 3
- depth(k) = 55% × k^(-0.5)

### Validation at p=0.12
- Dead zones correctly predicted
- Thresholds correctly predicted
- Intervention system works

## Falsified Hypotheses (6)

1. Decomposition rate higher above Nc
2. More total events above Nc
3. Lower trajectory variance above Nc
4. Better phase coverage above Nc
5. Wider attractor basins above Nc
6. β scaling with k (measurement challenge)

## Open Questions (Remaining)

1. Universality class (percolation? contact process?)
2. Temporal correlations (long-range?)
3. Connection to mean-field theory
4. Multi-dimensional extensions
