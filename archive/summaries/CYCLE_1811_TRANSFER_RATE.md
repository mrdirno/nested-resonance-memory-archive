# Cycle 1811: Transfer Rate Effect

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1811
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

Tested effect of energy transfer rate (composition efficiency).

**CONFIRMED: 18th parameter - transfer rate independent of pattern**

## Results

| Rate | N=29 | N=35 | Diff |
|------|------|------|------|
| 0.5 | 70% | 100% | 30pp |
| 0.6 | 67% | 100% | 33pp |
| 0.7 | 67% | 100% | 33pp |
| 0.8 | 60% | 100% | 40pp |
| 0.85 | 60% | 100% | 40pp |
| 0.9 | 60% | 100% | 40pp |
| 0.95 | 53% | 93% | 40pp |
| 1.0 | 57% | 87% | 30pp |

## Analysis

### Pattern Stability

All rates from 0.5 to 1.0:
- Peak (N=29): 53-70% coexistence
- Trough (N=35): 87-100% coexistence
- Difference: 30-40pp

### Optimal Range

Best pattern strength at 0.8-0.95 (40pp difference).

At extremes:
- 0.5: Pattern weakens slightly (30pp)
- 1.0: Pattern weakens slightly (30pp)

### 18th Parameter

Transfer rate doesn't affect dead zone location.
Pattern is determined by N, not energy efficiency.

## Conclusions

1. **Transfer rate independent**
2. **18 parameters tested**
3. **Only reproduction probability affects pattern**
4. **Pattern remarkably robust**
