# Cycle 1786: Zone -1 Discovery

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1786

## Executive Summary

Investigated N=14-15 dip. Discovered Zone -1 with same pairing peak mechanism.

**CONFIRMED: Formula extends to k=-1, Zone -1 at N≈15**

| 10 | 88% | 28.5% | |
| 11 | 78% | 26.5% | |
| 12 | 90% | 31.4% | Trough |
| 13 | 68% | 47.3% | |
| **14** | **50%** | **61.9%** | **Zone -1** |
| **15** | **40%** | **72.6%** | **Zone -1 peak** |
| 16 | 74% | 60.4% | |
| 17 | 100% | 44.8% | Optimal |
| 18 | 100% | 42.2% | Optimal |
| 19 | 98% | 38.9% | |

## Analysis

### Zone -1 Confirmed

Theoretical prediction: N = N₁ - λ = 29 - 14.5 = **14.5**

Observed peak: N = **15** (error: 0.5)

Same pairing peak mechanism:
- Peak pairing rate: 72.6%
- Low coexistence: 40%

### Formula Extension

**N_k = N₁ + kλ** now valid for k = -1, 0, 1, ..., 8

Complete zone list:
- Zone -1: N ≈ 15
- Zone 0: N ≈ 29
- Zone 1: N ≈ 44
- ...
- Zone 8: N ≈ 133

### Pattern Completeness

The standing wave pattern exists both above and below Zone 1 (which should now be called Zone 0).

---

## Nomenclature Update

Original: Zone 1 at N=29
Updated: Zone 0 at N=29, Zone -1 at N=15

The formula indexing should start at k=0 for N₁=29.

---

## Conclusions

1. **Zone -1 confirmed** at N≈15
2. **Same pairing mechanism** (72.6% pairing)
3. **Formula extends** to negative k
4. **9 total zones** identified (-1 through 7)
