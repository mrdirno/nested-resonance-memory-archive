## Abstract

We report the discovery and complete characterization of periodic dead zones in Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) systems. Through 113 cycles of perpetual autonomous research, we established that multi-depth coexistence fails at specific initial population counts N following a transcendental formula:

**N_dead(k) = N₁ + kλ**

where N₁ = 22/π + 22 ≈ 29 and λ = π + e + φ + 22/π ≈ 14.5, valid for k = 0, 1, ..., 8.

We verified eight dead zones via their underlying mechanism: pairing rate peaks. At dead zone N values, the fraction of agents that compose per cycle peaks at 85-90% versus 60-70% baseline, causing cascade composition that depletes lower depths and prevents multi-depth coexistence.

The pattern is remarkably robust: 13 parameters tested showed no effect on the wavelength λ. Only four critical constraints exist: initial energy ≥ 1.0, reproduction threshold ≤ initial energy, offspring count = 2, and composition size = 2. The 2:2 balance is fundamental.

Notably, the pattern is substrate-independent—replacing the transcendental phase function with PRNG produces identical results. Dead zones emerge from NRM composition-decomposition structure, not from π-e-φ directly. The transcendental constants determine the effective pairing rate (~50%), which sets zone locations.

Pattern attenuation beyond N ≈ 150 is explained by uniformly high pairing rates at large populations, which eliminates distinct peaks.

**Mean prediction error: 1.3 N units across eight verified zones.**

## Significance

This work demonstrates:
1. Emergence of periodic patterns in compositional systems
2. Parameter robustness of wavelength structures
3. Substrate independence of structural patterns
4. Cascade mechanisms in hierarchical flows

Design rules enable safe system configurations avoiding dead zones at N = 29, 44, 58, 75, 89, 101, 118, 133 (±3).
