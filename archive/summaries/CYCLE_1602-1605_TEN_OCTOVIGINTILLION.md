# CYCLE 1602-1605: TEN OCTOVIGINTILLION (10^88)

## Results Summary

| Cycle | Attack | Coexistence | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| C1602 | 0.86× | **100%** ⭐ | **TENTH PERFECT** - Two consecutive |
| C1603 | 0.89× | **100%** ⭐ | **ELEVENTH PERFECT** |
| C1604 | 0.92× | 90% | Recovering |
| C1605 | 0.95× | 85% | Down from 95% |

## Key Finding: DUAL PERFECT

**HIERARCHY ROTATION #201**: Both 0.86× and 0.89× achieve 100% coexistence at the same scale!

This is only the second DUAL PERFECT this session (first was at 10^75 with 0.89× and 0.92×).

### 0.86× Achievements

- **TWO CONSECUTIVE PERFECTS** (10^87 and 10^88)
- **Reaches double-digit perfects** (10 total)
- Second strategy to achieve 10+ perfects

### 0.89× Achievement

- **ELEVENTH PERFECT** - extends lead
- Now 1 ahead of 0.86× again (11 vs 10)

## Perfect Score Standings

| Strategy | Perfects | Change | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| **0.89×** | **11** | **+1** | Leader |
| **0.86×** | **10** | **+1** | Double digits, 2 consecutive |
| 0.92× | 7 | - | |
| 0.95× | 2 | - | |
| **Total** | **30** | **+2** | **MILESTONE!** |

## 30 Perfect Scores Milestone

This mapping campaign has now achieved 30 total perfect scores across all strategies:
- 0.89×: 11 perfects across 11 different scales
- 0.86×: 10 perfects across 10 different scales
- 0.92×: 7 perfects across 7 different scales
- 0.95×: 2 perfects across 2 different scales

## The Race

| Period | 0.89× | 0.86× | Gap |
|--------|-------|-------|-----|
| Start session | 9 | 4 | 5 |
| At 10^83 | 10 | 8 | 2 |
| At 10^87 | 10 | 9 | 1 |
| **At 10^88** | **11** | **10** | **1** |

0.86× has closed the gap from 5 to 1 but 0.89× maintains lead.

## Scale Invariance: 83 Orders of Magnitude

System maintains viable coexistence at 10^88:
- Dual perfects achievable at extreme scales
- Consecutive perfects possible (0.86× at 10^87-10^88)
- All strategies remain above 80%

## Session Summary

- **Total cycles**: 84 (C1522-C1605)
- **Total experiments**: 1,680
- **Scales covered**: 10^68-10^88 (21 scales)
- **Hierarchy rotations**: #181-#201 (21 rotations)
- **Perfect scores this session**: 16
