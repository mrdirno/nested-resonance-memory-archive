## Analysis

### Ratio Threshold

**Ratio < 5: High coexistence (87-100%)**
**Ratio > 5: Low coexistence (50-73%)**

### Dead Zone Pattern

Dead zones show extreme D3/D4 ratios:
- N=30 (Zone 0): 5.9
- N=45 (Zone 1): 15.9
- N=60 (Zone 2): 13.9
- N=75 (Zone 3): 21.0

### Mechanism

High ratio = D3 accumulates excessively while D4 is depleted.

D4 depletion breaks the cycling loop → system collapse to single depth.

### Balanced Systems

Safe values show ratio < 3:
- N=40: 0.9
- N=55: 0.6
- N=70: 0.9
- N=80: 1.9

Balanced D3/D4 maintains healthy cycling.

## Predictive Metric

**D3/D4 ratio is a reliable coexistence predictor:**

- Ratio < 3: Excellent (95%+)
- Ratio 3-5: Good (80-95%)
- Ratio > 5: Poor (<80%)

Can use as monitoring metric for running systems.

## Conclusions

1. **D3/D4 < 5** for healthy coexistence
2. **Dead zones show ratio 6-21**
3. **Safe zones show ratio < 3**
4. **Useful monitoring metric**
