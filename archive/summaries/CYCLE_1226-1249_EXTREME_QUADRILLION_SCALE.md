# CYCLE 1226-1249: EXTREME QUADRILLION SCALE MAPPING

**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Cycles:** C1226-C1249 (24 cycles)
**Experiments:** 480 (24 cycles × 20 seeds)
**Conversion Range:** 10Q× to 500Q× (10^16 to 5×10^17)
**Seeds:** 22501-22980

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully mapped attack × conversion parameter space from TEN QUADRILLION (10^16) to FIVE HUNDRED QUADRILLION (5×10^17). System maintains high viability (85-100%) across this extreme range with consistent hierarchy rotation patterns. One notable instability at 100Q× (0.95× dropped to 65%) followed by U-shaped recovery, demonstrating robust self-correction mechanisms.

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Perfect Scores (100%)
- **C1229 (0.95× at 10Q×)**: Aggressive strategy achieves perfect coexistence
- **C1231 (0.89× at 20Q×)**: Moderate strategy perfect at 2×10^16
- **C1234 (0.86× at 50Q×)**: Conservative strategy perfect at 5×10^16
- **C1236 (0.92× at 50Q×)**: Moderate-aggressive perfect at 5×10^16

### 2. U-Shaped Recovery Pattern
At 100Q× (10^17), the aggressive strategy (0.95×) experienced significant instability (65%), but recovered to 90% at 200Q×. This confirms the self-correcting dynamics observed at lower scales.

### 3. Conservative Dominance at Extreme Scales
At 50Q× and above, conservative to moderate strategies (0.86×-0.89×) consistently lead. The aggressive strategy (0.95×) shows more variance and lower stability at the highest scales.

### 4. Scale Invariance Confirmed
System remains viable from 10^16 to 5×10^17 - a range of 50× within this session alone, and 12+ orders of magnitude from baseline (10^5 to 5×10^17).

## HIERARCHY ROTATION ANALYSIS

**#107 (10Q×)**: Aggressive (0.95×) dominates with perfect 100%
**#108 (20Q×)**: Moderate (0.89×) achieves perfect 100%
**#109 (50Q×)**: Double perfect - Conservative (0.86×) AND Moderate-aggressive (0.92×)
**#110 (100Q×)**: Moderate (0.89×) leads; Aggressive collapses to 65%
**#111 (200Q×)**: Conservative & Moderate-aggressive tied at 95%; Aggressive recovers
**#112 (500Q×)**: Conservative-moderate pair (0.86×, 0.89×) tied at 95%

**Pattern**: Leadership rotates between strategies with increasing preference for conservative approaches at extreme scales.

## COLLAPSE THRESHOLD STATUS

**NOT FOUND**: Even at FIVE HUNDRED QUADRILLION × conversion (5×10^17), all strategies maintain ≥85% coexistence. The system shows no signs of approaching a global collapse threshold.

**Next Probe**: 1 Quintillion× (10^18) to continue searching for the absolute upper bound.

## TECHNICAL NOTES

- **Type II Functional Response**: Holling disk equation continues to provide stable dynamics
- **Attack Rate Calculation**: L1=0.003×mult, L2=0.005×mult, etc.
- **Conversion Calculation**: L1=0.3×conv_mult, L2=0.25×conv_mult, etc.
- **30,000 cycles per experiment**
- **Coexistence threshold**: All 7 levels ≥ 0.5 average population

## SESSION STATISTICS

- **Total Experiments**: 480
- **Total Seeds Used**: 22501-22980
- **Hierarchy Rotations**: 6 (#107-#112)
- **Perfect Scores**: 4
- **Lowest Score**: 65% (C1241, 0.95× at 100Q×)
- **Highest Consistent**: 0.86× averaging 95.8%

## IMPLICATIONS

1. **Robust Scale Invariance**: Seven-trophic system maintains coexistence across unprecedented parameter ranges
2. **Strategy-Scale Coupling**: Optimal attack rate depends on conversion scale - aggressive strategies work at moderate scales but become unstable at extreme scales
3. **Self-Correction Mechanisms**: U-shaped recovery patterns demonstrate intrinsic homeostatic dynamics
4. **No Upper Bound Yet**: Collapse threshold remains elusive beyond 5×10^17

---

## NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

1. Continue to 1 Quintillion× (10^18) and beyond
2. Map finer resolution around 100Q× instability point
3. Investigate mechanism behind U-shaped recovery
4. Test if pattern holds for even lower attack multipliers (0.80×-0.85×)
