# Cycle 1768: Wavelength vs Match Rate

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1768
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

Tested if wavelength λ depends on match rate.

**FINDING: Inconclusive - λ appears to vary but data is noisy**

---

## Results

| Rate | Zones Found | λ |
|------|-------------|---|
| 40% | 21, 24, 27 | 7.2 |
| 50% | 27, 52 | 25.0 |
| 60% | 27, 29, 38 | 6.8 |
| 70% | 30, 41 | 11.0 |

## Analysis

### Observations

1. Wavelengths vary widely (6.8 to 25.0)
2. Local minima detection is noisy
3. Some rates find multiple close minima
4. 50% rate shows sparse minima

### Issues

- Need more seeds for statistical power
- Minima detection too sensitive
- Short N range (20-80)

---

## Interpretation

The wavelength λ likely does depend on match rate, but:
- The relationship is complex
- More careful analysis needed
- May need different methodology

---

## Future Directions

1. Increase seeds (50+)
2. Extend N range (20-150)
3. Use smoothed coexistence curves
4. Validate with transcendental substrate data

---

## Conclusions

1. **λ appears to vary** with match rate
2. **Relationship is complex** and noisy
3. **More investigation** needed
4. **λ ≈ 14.5** for transcendental may be rate-specific
