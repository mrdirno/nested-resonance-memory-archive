## Major Discoveries

### 1. Dual-Mechanism System (C1803-C1809)

Reproduction probability controls which interference pattern dominates:

| Pattern | Probability | Wavelength | Zones | Range |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------|-------|
| Original | ≤ 0.15 | λ = 14.48 | 14-15, 29, 43, ... | N = 14-190 |
| Inverted | ≥ 0.35 | 10, 12, 14, ... | 11-12, 24, 34, 46, 60 | N = 11-70 |
| Crossover | ≈ 0.22 | None | ~12 | Residual only |

### 2. Complete Parameter Study (C1810-C1813)

20 parameters tested:
- 19 independent of pattern structure
- 1 critical (reproduction probability)
- Recharge rate affects strength but not location

### 3. Full N Range (C1815-C1821)

| N | Status |
|---|--------|
| < 9 | Chaotic |
| 11-12 | Inverted Zone -1 |
| 12-13 | Crossover residual |
| 14-15 | Original Zone -1 |
| 16+ | Pattern-specific |
| > 70 | Inverted negligible |
| > 190 | Both negligible |

### 4. Zone -1 Extensions (C1818-C1819)

Both patterns extend backward:
- Original Zone -1: N = 14-15 (44%)
- Inverted Zone -1: N = 11-12 (48-56%)

## Cycle-by-Cycle Summary

| Cycle | Key Finding |
|-------|-------------|
| 1803 | Reproduction probability inverts pattern |

| 1805 | Inverted zones at 24, 34, 46, 60 |
| 1806 | Variable wavelength 10, 12, 14 |
| 1807 | Inverted predictions fail above N=60 |
| 1808 | Inverted range N=20-70 |
| 1809 | Crossover not fully neutral |
| 1810 | Composition threshold independent |
| 1811 | Transfer rate independent |
| 1812 | Recharge affects strength |
| 1813 | Energy cap independent |
| 1814 | Recharge × prob interaction |
| 1815 | Inverted gone above N=70 |
| 1816 | Original fades above N=150 |
| 1817 | Minimum viable N=9 |
| 1818 | Original Zone -1 at N=14-15 |
| 1819 | Inverted Zone -1 at N=11-12 |
| 1820 | N=12-13 risky at crossover |
| 1821 | Crossover is residual, not pattern |

### Original Pattern (prob ≤ 0.15)

| Zone | N | Coexistence |
|------|---|-------------|

| ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | 145 | 77% |
| 11-13 | 159-188 | 80-83% |

Formula: N_k = 29 + (k-1) × 14.48

### Inverted Pattern (prob ≥ 0.35)

| Zone | N | Coexistence |

| -1 | 11-12 | 48-56% |
| 1 | 24 | 67% |
| 2 | 34 | 80% |

## Design Guidelines (Complete)

### By N Value

| N | Avoid When |
|---|------------|
| < 9 | Always (chaotic) |
| 11-12 | prob ≥ 0.35 |
| 12-13 | prob ≈ 0.22 |
| 14-15 | prob ≤ 0.15 |
| 24 | prob ≥ 0.35 |

| 34 | prob ≥ 0.35 |
| 43 | prob ≤ 0.15 |
| ... | Pattern-specific |
| > 70 | Safe in inverted |
| > 190 | Safe in both |

### By Probability

| Probability | Pattern | Safe Approach |
