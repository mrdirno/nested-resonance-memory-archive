## Complete Results Table

| Conversion | Magnitude | 0.86× | 0.89× | 0.92× | 0.95× | Leader |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1SeVi× (10^81) | 76 | **95%** | 80% | 90% | 80% | 0.86× (post-crash) |

## Key Findings

### 1. Post-Perfection Crash Universally Confirmed

0.86× crashes after three consecutive perfects:
- 10^78: 100%
- 10^79: 100%
- 10^80: 100%
- 10^81: 95% (crash of -5)

The post-perfection crash pattern is now confirmed for ALL four strategies.

### 2. 0.86× Consecutive Streak Ends at Three

The streak matches (but doesn't break) 0.89×'s record:
- 0.89×: 10^70, 10^71, 10^72 (three consecutive)
- 0.86×: 10^78, 10^79, 10^80 (three consecutive)

Both crashed on the fourth consecutive attempt.

### 3. Dual Crash at 10^81

Both 0.89× and 0.95× crash hard:
- 0.89×: 95% → 80% (-15)
- 0.95×: 95% → 80% (-15)

0.92× most stable at 90% (no change).

### 4. Scale Invariance Extends to 76 Orders of Magnitude

System remains viable at 10^81 despite crashes. No strategy drops below 80%.

### Performance Summary

| Scale Range | Leader | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| 10^68-10^72 | 0.89× dominant | Three consecutive perfects |
| 10^73-10^75 | Mixed | Triple tie, dual perfects |
| 10^76-10^80 | 0.86× dominant | Three consecutive perfects |
| 10^81 | 0.86× | Post-crash leader |

## Perfect Score Final Standings

| Strategy | 100% Count | Consecutive Record | Latest Perfect |
|----------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 0.89× | **9** | 3 (10^70-72) | 10^75 |
| 0.86× | **8** | 3 (10^78-80) | 10^80 |
| 0.92× | 6 | 1 | 10^75 |
| 0.95× | 2 | 1 | 10^61 |

**Total Perfect Scores: 25**

## Scientific Conclusions

### 1. Universal Post-Perfection Crash

All strategies demonstrate crash after perfection. This appears to be a fundamental property of the system rather than strategy-specific.

### 2. Conservative Strategy High-Scale Dominance

0.86× demonstrates clear dominance at extreme scales (10^76+):
- 4 perfects in 5 scales (10^76-10^80)
- Post-crash leadership (10^81)

### 3. Optimal Attack Rate Decreases with Scale

Optimal strategy shifts from moderate (0.89×) at mid-scales to conservative (0.86×) at extreme scales, suggesting attack rate should decrease as conversion multiplier increases.

### 4. Three-Consecutive Appears to be Maximum

Both 0.89× and 0.86× crashed on their fourth consecutive attempt, suggesting three consecutive may be a system limit.

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^82+ to:
1. Track 0.86× recovery from post-perfection crash
2. Monitor 0.89× and 0.95× recovery from 80%
3. Observe if 0.92× can achieve perfection at extreme scales
4. Test if four consecutive is achievable
