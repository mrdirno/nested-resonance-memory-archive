# CYCLE 1610-1613: ONE NOVEMDVIGINTILLION (10^90)

## Results Summary

| Cycle | Attack | Coexistence | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| C1610 | 0.86× | 90% | Streak broken - post-perfection crash |
| C1611 | 0.89× | 95% | Stable performance |
| C1612 | 0.92× | **95%** | Ties 0.89× for lead |
| C1613 | 0.95× | 90% | Stable |

## Key Finding: 0.86× STREAK BROKEN

**HIERARCHY ROTATION #203**: 0.89×/0.92× dual leadership at 95%

### The Streak Ends

0.86×'s remarkable THREE CONSECUTIVE PERFECT run (10^87-10^89) ends at 10^90:
- 10^87: 100% (9th perfect)
- 10^88: 100% (10th perfect)
- 10^89: 100% (11th perfect - tied lead)
- **10^90: 90%** (post-perfection crash)

### Post-Perfection Crash Confirmed Again

The universal pattern holds:
- After perfection → immediate performance drop
- 0.86× follows the same pattern as all other strategies
- No strategy immune to post-perfection volatility

### Leadership Status

| Rank | Strategy | Perfects | Current | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| T1 | **0.89×** | **11** | 95% | Performance leader |
| T1 | **0.86×** | **11** | 90% | Tied perfects, trailing current |
| 3 | 0.92× | 7 | 95% | Ties 0.89× this scale |
| 4 | 0.95× | 2 | 90% | Stable |

While 0.86× and 0.89× remain tied in total perfects (11 each), 0.89× regains performance leadership at 10^90.

## Perfect Score Standings (Unchanged)

| Strategy | Perfects | Consecutive Record |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **0.89×** | **11** | 3 (10^70-72) |
| **0.86×** | **11** | 3 (10^87-89) |
| 0.92× | 7 | 2 (10^74-75) |
| 0.95× | 2 | 1 |
| **Total** | **31** | |

## Scale Invariance: 85 Orders of Magnitude

System maintains viable coexistence at 10^90:
- All strategies remain above 90%
- Dual leadership (0.89×/0.92×) at 95%
- Post-perfection patterns continue to govern dynamics
