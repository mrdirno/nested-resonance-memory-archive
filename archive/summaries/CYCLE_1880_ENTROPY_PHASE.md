# Cycle 1880: Entropy-Phase Relationship

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1880
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

**Entropy evolution is the key differentiator, not phase alignment**

- Dead zone: entropy drops (0.74 → 0.41), correlation +0.27
- Safe zone: entropy stable (1.19 → 1.10), correlation -0.43

## Results

### N=14 (Dead Zone)

| Cycle | Entropy | Resonance |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 5 | 0.74 | 0.94 |
| 10 | 0.89 | 0.50 |
| 20 | 0.54 | 0.20 |
| 50 | 0.41 | 0.40 |

**Correlation: +0.27** (weak positive)

### N=21 (Safe Zone)

| Cycle | Entropy | Resonance |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 5 | 1.19 | 0.92 |
| 10 | 1.28 | 0.40 |
| 20 | 1.07 | 0.30 |
| 50 | 1.10 | 0.59 |

**Correlation: -0.43** (moderate negative)

---

## Interpretation

1. **Entropy evolution is key**: Dead zones lose entropy, safe zones maintain it
2. **Resonance drops in both**: Early high resonance, then lower
3. **Different correlations**: Dead (+0.27) vs Safe (-0.43)
4. **Confirms C1866**: Entropy stability determines fate

The early warning system correctly targets entropy, not phase resonance.

---

## Conclusion

Phase resonance is not the primary differentiator between dead and safe zones. Entropy evolution (stable vs declining) is the critical factor that the early warning system correctly identifies.
