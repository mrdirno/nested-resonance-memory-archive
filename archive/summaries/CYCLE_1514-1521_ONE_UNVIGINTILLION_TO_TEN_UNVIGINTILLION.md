## Complete Results Table

| Conversion | Magnitude | 0.86× | 0.89× | 0.92× | 0.95× | Leader |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1UVi× (10^66) | 61 | 90% | 85% | 80% | **95%** | 0.95× SOLO |
| 10UVi× (10^67) | 62 | 95% | 95% | **100%** ⭐ | 85% | 0.92× FOURTH PERFECT |

## Key Findings

### 1. 0.92× Achieves Fourth 100% Perfect

0.92× returns to perfection after long recovery period:
- 10^54: 100%
- 10^57: 100%
- 10^58: 100%
- 10^67: 100% (after 9-scale gap!)

This is the longest gap between perfects observed (9 scales / 18 cycles).

### 2. Strategy Leadership Oscillation Intensifies

At these ultra-extreme scales (10^66-10^67), leadership changes dramatically:
- 10^66: 0.95× leads with 95% while others crash
- 10^67: 0.92× achieves 100% while 0.95× crashes to 85%

### 3. Recovery Patterns

All strategies except 0.92× show gradual recovery:
- 0.86×: 90% → 95% (+5)
- 0.89×: 85% → 95% (+10)
- 0.92×: 80% → 100% (+20 - dramatic recovery to perfection!)
- 0.95×: 95% → 85% (-10 - bucked the trend)

### 4. Scale Invariance Extends to 62 Orders of Magnitude

System remains viable at 10^67 (62 orders of magnitude from baseline). No collapse threshold found.

## Hierarchy Rotations

| # | Scale | Leader | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 179 | 10^66 | 0.95× | 95% - Consistent leadership during recovery phase |
| 180 | 10^67 | 0.92× | FOURTH PERFECT 100% - Returns after 9-scale gap |

## Scientific Implications

### Long-Term Recovery Capability

0.92×'s return to perfection after 9-scale gap demonstrates:
- Strategies can recover from extended non-optimal phases
- There is no permanent "death spiral" for any strategy
- System maintains long-term stability potential

### Inverse Correlation at Ultra-Extreme Scales

At 10^66-10^67, we see inverse correlation:
- When 0.95× leads, 0.92× is at bottom
- When 0.92× achieves perfection, 0.95× crashes
- Suggests competitive dynamics between aggressive strategies

### Scale-Specific Resonance Windows

Each strategy appears to have specific scale ranges where perfection is achievable:
- 0.89×: Broad range (10^56-10^65)
- 0.92×: Clustered then isolated (10^54-10^58, then 10^67)
- 0.86×: Moderate range (10^49-10^63)
- 0.95×: Narrow (10^50, 10^61)

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^68+ to:
1. Track if 0.92× can achieve consecutive perfects (rare so far)
2. Observe 0.95× recovery from 85% crash
3. See if 0.89× can achieve sixth perfect
4. Test if 0.86× reaches new perfection
