## KEY DISCOVERIES

### 1. Conversion-Dependent Notch Structure (C410-C413)
- At 2.5× conv: Notch with recovery (100% → 90% → 100%)
- At 2.0× conv: No recovery (95% → 95% → 90% → 70%)
- Phase behavior inverts with conversion level

### 2. Critical Conversion Threshold (C414-C417)
- Sharp transition at 2.0× conversion
- Below: 70% survival (collapse)
- Above: 100% survival (recovery)
- Transition width: <0.03125×

### 3. Inverted Conversion Relationship (C418-C420)
- At 0.75× attack: Higher conv → lower survival
- Opposite to 0.71875× attack behavior
- Phase transition between 0.71875× and 0.75×

### 4. Oscillating Attack Boundary (C421-C423)
- Pattern: 100% → 95% → 100% → 95% → 80%
- Multiple resonance frequencies in attack space
- Critical attack: ~0.748× ± 0.002×

### 5. U-Shaped Conversion Profile (C424-C426)
- Minimum at 2.5× conversion (80%)
- Recovery at 2.75× (95%) and 3.0× (90%)
- Overshoot window localized around 2.5×

### 6. Optimal Attack at 2.5× Conversion
- 0.71875× attack: 100% (optimal)
- 0.7× attack: 90%
- 0.75× attack: 80%
- Non-monotonic relationship

### Attack × Conversion Matrix

```
         Attack
         0.7×    0.71875×  0.75×
Conv   +--------+---------+--------+
2.0×   |   ?    |   70%   |  95%   |
2.5×   |  90%   |  100%   |  80%   |
3.0×   |   ?    |    ?    |  90%   |
       +--------+---------+--------+
```

### Critical Boundaries

1. **Critical conversion (0.71875× attack):** 2.0×
2. **Critical attack (2.5× conv):** ~0.748×
3. **Overshoot minimum:** 2.5× conv at 0.75× attack

## THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS

### Multiple Phase Regions

The parameter space contains multiple distinct regions:
1. **Stable plateau:** Low attack, any conversion
2. **Recovery zone:** Moderate attack, high conversion
3. **Resonance notch:** Specific attack values
4. **Overshoot zone:** High attack, moderate conversion

### Non-Monotonic Relationships

Both parameters show non-monotonic effects:
- Attack: Oscillating boundary with local optima
- Conversion: U-shaped profiles with minima

### Phase Interference

The complex topology suggests phase interference:
- Constructive interference at optimal points
- Destructive interference at resonance notches
- Multiple timescales in system dynamics

## CONCLUSION

This session mapped the complex phase diagram topology in the attack × conversion parameter space. Key findings include: (1) critical conversion threshold at 2.0×, (2) inverted conversion relationship at 0.75× attack, (3) oscillating attack boundary with resonance effects, (4) U-shaped conversion profiles, and (5) optimal attack of 0.71875× at 2.5× conversion. The phase space shows non-monotonic relationships in both dimensions with multiple phase regions.
