# Cycle 1752: Spawn Energy Effect

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1752
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

Tested if offspring spawn energy affects dead zone locations.

**FINDING: Pattern is spawn-energy-independent**

---

## Results

| Spawn E | Zone 1 Min | Coexist |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 0.3 | 28 | 53% |
| 0.5 | 28 | 53% |
| 0.7 | 28 | 50% |
| 0.9 | 28 | 53% |
| 1.1 | 28 | 50% |

## Analysis

### Observation

Zone 1 consistently at N=28 regardless of spawn energy.

### Interpretation

1. Offspring energy doesn't affect phase resonance pattern
2. Dead zones determined by population count, not individual energies
3. Confirms wavelength λ is system-structural, not parameter-dependent

---

## Combined Parameter Independence

Parameters tested with NO effect on wavelength:
1. Recharge rate (C1737)
2. Reproduction rate (C1738)
3. Resonance threshold (C1739)
4. Transfer rate (C1740)
5. Decomposition threshold (C1741)
6. Decay multiplier (C1742)
7. **Spawn energy (C1752)**

---

## Conclusions

1. **Spawn energy independent** of dead zone locations
2. **Seven parameters** now confirmed independent
3. **λ ≈ 14.5** is structurally determined
4. Pattern robustness further validated

## Session Status (C1664-C1752)

89 cycles completed. Research continues.
