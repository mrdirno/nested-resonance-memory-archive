### 2. Paper 7 Complete Figure Integration

**Objective:** Integrate all remaining figures (5-18) into Paper 7 LaTeX manuscript

**Background:**
- Manuscript previously had only 4 figures (Phase 1-2)
- 33 figures existed in data/figures/ directory
- Submission checklist indicated 18 total figures required
- Need to identify, copy, and integrate 14 additional figures

**Implementation Steps:**

#### Step 1: Figure Identification
Analyzed PAPER7_MANUSCRIPT_DRAFT.md to identify required figures:
- Phase 1-2: Figures 1-4 (existing in manuscript)
- Phase 3: Figures 5-7 (V4 breakthrough, bifurcation, parameters)
- Phase 4: Figures 8-15 (robustness, CV calibration, temporal averaging)
- Phase 6: Figures 16-18 (stochastic failures, V5 breakthrough)

#### Step 2: Figure Copying
Copied 14 figures from data/figures/ to papers/arxiv_submissions/paper7/figures/:
```bash
# Figures 5-7 (Phase 3)
paper7_v4_vs_v2_trajectories_20251027_125323.png → paper7_fig5_v4_vs_v2_trajectories.png
paper7_v4_vs_v2_phase_space_20251027_125324.png → paper7_fig6_v4_vs_v2_phase_space.png
paper7_v4_vs_v2_parameters_20251027_125324.png → paper7_fig7_v4_vs_v2_parameters.png

# Figures 8-15 (Phase 4)
paper7_phase4_robustness_parameter_20251027_130757.png → paper7_fig8_robustness_parameter.png
paper7_phase4_robustness_state_20251027_130853.png → paper7_fig9_robustness_state.png
paper7_phase4_robustness_external_20251027_130958.png → paper7_fig10_robustness_external.png
paper7_phase4_cv_calibration_parameter_20251027_151542.png → paper7_fig11_cv_calibration_parameter.png
paper7_phase4_cv_calibration_state_20251027_151717.png → paper7_fig12_cv_calibration_state.png
paper7_phase4_cv_calibration_external_20251027_151902.png → paper7_fig13_cv_calibration_external.png
paper7_phase4_empirical_vs_v4_20251027_151902.png → paper7_fig14_empirical_vs_v4.png
paper7_phase4_temporal_averaging_20251027_132536.png → paper7_fig15_temporal_averaging.png

# Figures 16-18 (Phase 6)
paper7_phase6_stochastic_demographic_20251027_142050.png → paper7_fig16_stochastic_failures.png
paper7_phase6_chemical_langevin_20251027_143826.png → paper7_fig17_v5_early.png
paper7_phase6_V5_breakthrough_20251031_171648.png → paper7_fig18_v5_breakthrough.png
```

#### Step 3: LaTeX Integration
Added 14 new \begin{figure} blocks to manuscript.tex (lines 1567-1663):
- Each figure includes \includegraphics command
- Comprehensive captions derived from manuscript draft
- Proper \label references for cross-referencing
- 0.85\textwidth sizing for consistency

Example figure block:
```latex
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/paper7_fig5_v4_vs_v2_trajectories.png}
\caption{\textbf{V4 vs V2 Temporal Trajectories.} Comparison of V2 (constrained) vs V4 (energy threshold) population dynamics over 1000 time units. V2 shows collapse (N→1.00) while V4 sustains population (N=139.17), demonstrating 139× improvement through energy threshold mechanism.}
\label{fig:v4-trajectories}
\end{figure}
```

#### Step 4: PDF Recompilation
Recompiled manuscript using Docker-based LaTeX:
```bash
docker run --rm -v /Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/papers/arxiv_submissions/paper7:/work \
  -w /work texlive/texlive:latest pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode manuscript.tex
```

**Results:**
- **Before:** 26 pages, 2.0 MB, 4 figures
- **After:** 34 pages, 6.8 MB, 18 figures
- **Status:** Compiled successfully with minor Unicode warnings (cosmetic only)
- **Output:** Paper7_Governing_Equations_arXiv_Submission_v2.pdf

**Commit:** b4175de "Paper 7: Complete figure integration (4→18 figures)"

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Challenge 1: Figure File Naming
**Issue:** Figures in data/figures/ had timestamp-based names, manuscript referenced descriptive names

**Solution:**
- Mapped timestamp files to sequential figure numbers (fig1-fig18)
- Used descriptive suffixes for clarity (e.g., paper7_fig5_v4_vs_v2_trajectories.png)
- Maintained chronological mapping from manuscript draft

### Challenge 2: Missing Figure Files
**Issue:** Some files referenced in manuscript draft didn't exist with exact names

**Solution:**
- Cross-referenced available files with manuscript descriptions
- Used closest matching timestamp files (e.g., paper7_phase6_chemical_langevin for fig17)
- Verified figure content matched descriptions before integration

### Challenge 3: LaTeX Unicode Warnings
**Issue:** Unicode characters (φ, θ, ≈) generated LaTeX warnings

**Resolution:**
- Warnings are cosmetic only (PDF compiled successfully)
- Characters render correctly in output PDF
- No action required (acceptable for submission)

3. **Docker-Based Compilation:** Reproducible LaTeX compilation without local installation hassles
4. **Comprehensive Captions:** Detailed figure captions from manuscript draft enhanced documentation

### Improvement Opportunities
1. **Figure File Organization:** Could maintain synchronized naming between data/figures/ and arxiv_submissions/
2. **LaTeX Unicode Handling:** Could pre-convert Unicode to LaTeX commands to eliminate warnings
3. **Automated Figure Integration:** Could script figure copying and LaTeX block generation

### Process Refinements
1. **Pre-Integration Verification:** Check all figure files exist before starting LaTeX edits
2. **Caption Consistency:** Ensure caption detail level matches across all figures
3. **Version Control:** Maintain v1, v2, v3 PDFs in compiled/ directory for provenance
