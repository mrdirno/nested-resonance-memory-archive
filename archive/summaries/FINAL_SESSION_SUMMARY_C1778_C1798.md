## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Complete Mechanism Understanding
- Pairing peaks cause cascade composition
- D0 depletes completely at peaks
- Coexistence depends on D3-D4 cycling loop

### 2. Formula Verification
- N_k = (22/π + 22) + k(π + e + φ + 22/π)
- Mean error: 0.80 N units
- 10 zones verified (k = -1 to 8)

### 3. Design Rules
- +18 percentage point improvement
- Avoid N = 15, 29, 44, 58 (critical zones)
- Safe range: N = 17-27 or troughs

### 4. Monitoring Metrics
- D3/D4 ratio < 5 for healthy coexistence
- 11-15% survival ratio
- Fate determined by cycle 7

### 5. Mathematical Structure
- 22 ≈ 7π key relationship
- λ contains π, e, φ, 22/π
- Deep mathematical structure

2. Monitor depths occupied ≥ 2
3. Track total agents (5-15% of N)
4. Early check at cycle 10
