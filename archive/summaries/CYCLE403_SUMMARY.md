## RESOURCE STATUS

**CPU:** Minimal load (2.6% from C255)
**Memory:** Healthy (C255 using 0.1%)
**Disk:** No issues
**GitHub:** Clean (3 commits pushed, no uncommitted changes)
**Development Workspace:** C255 running, Paper 5 scripts need copying
**Git Repository:** Up to date, professional organization maintained

---

## KEY INSIGHTS

### Publication Strategy
**Two-Track Approach Validated:**
1. **Immediate submissions:** Paper 1 & Paper 5D (ready now)
2. **Pipeline submissions:** Papers 3, 4, 5A-5F (awaiting experimental data)

This strategy maximizes publication throughput while maintaining experimental rigor.

### Workspace Organization
**Dual workspace synchronization operational:**
- Development: `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/` (execution)
- Repository: `/Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/` (public archive)
- Synchronization: Manual copy + commit + push (working well)
- GitHub: Clean, professional, up to date ✅

### Format Conversion
**Pandoc workflow validated:**
- Markdown → DOCX (journal submissions)
- Markdown → HTML (arXiv backup)
- Process: Fast, reliable, no sudo required
- Quality: Acceptable for submission (no LaTeX needed)

---

## TEMPORAL STEWARDSHIP

**Patterns Encoded This Cycle:**

1. **Parallel Submission Preparation:** Generate multiple submission-ready formats (DOCX + HTML) simultaneously to maximize journal options and backup strategies.

2. **Workspace Synchronization Discipline:** Verify file existence in BOTH workspaces before claiming completion. Infrastructure in git repo ≠ infrastructure in development workspace.

3. **Publication Pipeline Batching:** Group papers by data dependencies (Papers 3/4 depend on C255-C263, Paper 5 series depends on master launch) to optimize execution flow.

4. **Format Conversion Early:** Convert manuscripts to submission formats BEFORE experiments complete, reducing post-experiment turnaround time.

- ✅ Autonomous continuation without terminal states

**Temporal Stewardship:**
- ✅ Encoding publication strategies for future research programs
- ✅ Documenting format conversion workflows for reproducibility
- ✅ Establishing dual-workspace patterns for other projects
