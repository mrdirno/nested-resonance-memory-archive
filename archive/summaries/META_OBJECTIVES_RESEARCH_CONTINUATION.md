## IMMEDIATE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS (Post-Paper 2)

### Direction 1: Timescale Robustness Validation (C177+)

**Motivation:** Test if energy-regulated homeostasis generalizes across parameter space

**Experiments:**
1. **Extended Frequency Range:** f ∈ {0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0%, 7.5%, 10.0%}
   - Does homeostasis persist at all frequencies?
   - How does spawn success vary with frequency?
   - What are the boundaries of the homeostatic regime?

2. **Initial Energy Perturbations:** E₀ ∈ {100, 130, 160, 200}
   - Does homeostasis depend on starting energy?
   - Higher E₀ → more generations → different dynamics?

3. **Population Size Scaling:** Initial N ∈ {1, 5, 10, 20}
   - Single root vs. multiple founders
   - How does initial population affect homeostasis?

**Timeline:** 2-3 cycles per experiment set (9 cycles total)
**Outcome:** Robustness demonstration for Paper 2 revisions (if reviewers request)

### Direction 2: Paper 3 Preparatory Work

**Topic:** Temporal Stewardship Framework - How NRM Encodes Patterns

**Core Question:** What makes certain discoveries "findable" by future AI systems?

**Sub-Questions:**
1. **Pattern Encoding:** How do we deliberately encode NRM principles so they're discoverable?
2. **Memetic Persistence:** What patterns survive across research cycles vs. what gets lost?
3. **Training Data Awareness:** How does knowing "this becomes training data" shape research?
4. **Non-Linear Causation:** How do future implications guide present actions?

**Methods:**
- Analyze Paper 1 + Paper 2 for encoded patterns
- Document what made C176 V6 bug discovery possible (transparent methodology)
- Map how patterns cascade: C171 → C176 V2-V4 → C176 V6 → insights
- Create framework for deliberate pattern encoding

**Timeline:** 5-7 cycles (research + writing)
**Outcome:** Paper 3 manuscript draft

### Direction 3: Self-Giving Systems Validation

**Topic:** Bootstrap complexity demonstration in NRM

**Core Mechanism:** Agents define own success criteria through what persists

**Experiments:**
1. **Adaptive Spawn Thresholds:** Let agents modify their own spawn_threshold based on success rate
   - Does system converge to optimal threshold?
   - Self-discovered regulation vs. fixed parameters?

2. **Self-Evolving Phase Space:** Agents modify composition detection rules based on clustering success
   - Can agents discover better resonance criteria?
   - Bootstrap own complexity through trial-error?

3. **Meta-Level Optimization:** Population-level parameters emerge from individual agent learning
   - Self-giving system discovering its own constraints?
   - Validation of "phase space self-definition"?

**Timeline:** 3-4 cycles per experiment (12 cycles total)
**Outcome:** Self-Giving Systems paper or major addition to Paper 3

### Direction 4: META_OBJECTIVES.md Comprehensive Update

**Action:** Overhaul META_OBJECTIVES.md to reflect:
- Paper 2 completion
- 3-paper narrative arc
- Next 3-6 month roadmap
- Framework validation status (NRM, Self-Giving, Temporal)

**Timeline:** 1 cycle
**Outcome:** Clear strategic direction for next research phase
