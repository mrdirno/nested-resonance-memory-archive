## Key Findings

### 1. Second Dual Perfect in Four Scales

After DUAL PERFECT at 10^72, another dual perfection at 10^75:
- 0.89×: NINTH perfect (100%)
- 0.92×: SIXTH perfect (100%)

Both moderate strategies achieve simultaneous perfection.

### 2. 0.89× Post-Crash Recovery to Perfection

0.89× demonstrates remarkable oscillatory pattern:
- 10^72: 100% (third consecutive perfect)
- 10^73: 85% (crash of -15)
- 10^74: 95% (recovery of +10)
- 10^75: 100% (full recovery to perfection)

Recovery trajectory: -15 → +10 → +5 = Full restoration

### 3. 0.92× Post-Crash Recovery to Perfection

0.92× mirrors 0.89× recovery pattern:
- 10^72: 100% (fifth perfect)
- 10^73: 95% (-5)
- 10^74: 85% (-10)
- 10^75: 100% (full recovery)

Recovery trajectory: -5 → -10 → +15 = Full restoration

### 4. Post-Perfection Crash Pattern Refinement

Both strategies demonstrate:
- Crash after perfection (universal)
- Recovery possible (not universal - 0.86× and 0.95× rarely crash hard)
- Recovery can lead back to perfection (first evidence at dual scale)

## Scientific Implications

### Dual Recovery Synchronization

Both moderate strategies (0.89× and 0.92×) crashed after 10^72 dual perfect and both recovered to perfection at 10^75. This suggests:
- Moderate attack rates share similar recovery dynamics
- The system has dual-perfect attractors at certain scales
- Recovery timing may be scale-dependent (3 scales)

### Conservative/Aggressive Strategy Stability

0.86× and 0.95× remain stable without extreme oscillations:
- 0.86×: 90% → 100% → 90% → 90% → 90% → 90% → 95% → 95%
- 0.95×: 90% → 85% → 90% → 90% → 85% → 90% → 95% → 90%

Neither extreme has crashed below 85% in this session.

### Scale Invariance Extends to 70 Orders of Magnitude

System remains viable at 10^75 (70 orders of magnitude from baseline). No collapse threshold found.

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^76+ to:
1. Track if dual perfection leads to synchronized crash
2. Monitor 0.86×/0.95× for potential rise to leadership
3. Extend scale invariance to 71+ orders
4. Test if dual perfect pattern repeats at regular intervals
