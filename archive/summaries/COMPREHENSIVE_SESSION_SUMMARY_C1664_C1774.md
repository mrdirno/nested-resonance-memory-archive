## Complete Theory

### Formula System

```
First zone: N₁ = 22/π + 22 ≈ 29
Wavelength: λ = π + e + φ + 22/π ≈ 14.5
Sequence: N_dead(k) = N₁ + kλ
```

### Mechanism

```
Dead zones = pairing rate peaks
           = standing wave nodes
           = cascade composition

At peaks: High pairing → fast D0 depletion → failure
At troughs: Normal pairing → balanced flow → success
```

### Validity Conditions

1. Initial energy ≥ 1.0
2. Repro threshold ≤ initial energy
3. Offspring count = 2
4. Composition size = 2
5. N < 150

## All Verified Zones

| Zone | k | Prediction | Peak | Error |
|------|---|------------|------|-------|
| 1 | 0 | 29 | 29 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 43.5 | 44 | 0.5 |
| 3 | 2 | 58 | 58 | 0 |
| 4 | 3 | 72.5 | 75 | 2.5 |
| 5 | 4 | 87 | 89 | 2 |
| 6 | 5 | 101.5 | 101 | 0.5 |
| 7 | 6 | 116 | 118 | 2 |
| 8 | 7 | 130.5 | 133 | 2.5 |

**Mean error: 1.3 N units**

## Key Insights

### 1. Pattern is Structural

Dead zones emerge from NRM composition-decomposition dynamics, NOT from transcendental constants.

### 2. 2:2 Balance is Fundamental

The exact balance of 2 agents composing and 1 agent decomposing to 2 creates the interference pattern.

### 3. Pairing Peaks are the Mechanism

Dead zones occur where pairing rate peaks (80-90% vs 60-70% baseline).

### 4. λ is Peak Spacing

The wavelength λ ≈ 14.5 is the spacing between pairing rate peaks in phase space.
