**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycles:** 1697-1709 (13 cycles)
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive mechanism investigation establishing WHY n=25 achieves 96% coexistence and WHY n=30 fails.

**COMPLETE MECHANISM**:
- n=25 has optimal offspring ratio (55-65%) creating low-energy D1
- n=30 has D1 decomposition trap (ratio ~1.2 vs >4 needed)

## Complete Causal Chain

```
n=25 optimal because:
├─ Offspring ratio in optimal range (55-65%)
│  └─ Creates low-energy D1 agents (mean 0.823)
│     └─ D1 survives (doesn't decompose)
│        └─ D1→D2 ratio >4
│           └─ D2+ structure establishes
│              └─ Dynamic equilibrium
│                 └─ 96% coexistence

n=30 fails because:
├─ High offspring ratio (>65%)
│  └─ Creates D1 with higher energy (mean 0.889)
│     └─ D1 exceeds decomposition threshold
│        └─ D1→D2 ratio collapses to ~1.2
│           └─ D1 decomposition trap
│              └─ D2+ cannot establish
│                 └─ 55% coexistence

| Cycle | Investigation | Finding |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| C1697 | Energy variance | Not differentiator |
| C1698 | Timing | Mean cycle important |
| C1699 | Creation energy | n=25 lowest (1.416) |
| C1700 | Phase alignment | Product metric |
| C1701 | Product validation | Not sufficient alone |
| C1702 | Survivor dynamics | D1@100 correlates |
| C1703 | Multi-factor | Combined score needed |
| C1704 | Agent energy | n=25=0.823 (lowest) |
| C1705 | Timing paradox | Later but lower |

## Critical Metrics

### For Success (n=25)

| Metric | Value | Threshold |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Offspring ratio | 57.6% | 55-65% |
| Agent energy at comp | 0.823 | < 0.85 |
| Mean creation energy | 1.416 | < 1.5 |
| D1→D2 ratio | 5.03 | > 4 |

### For Failure (n=30)

| Metric | Value | Problem |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Offspring ratio | 80.2% | Too high |
| Agent energy | 0.889 | Too high |
| D1→D2 ratio | 1.22 | Catastrophic |

## Theoretical Insights

### Two Failure Modes

1. **Too few compositions** (n=15): Insufficient D1 created
2. **D1 trap** (n=30): D1 created but decomposes

n=25 avoids both.

### Critical Balance Points

Success requires balance at multiple levels:
- Offspring ratio: 55-65% (not max)
- Agent energy: ~0.82-0.85
- D1→D2 ratio: >4

### Self-Organizing Optimum

The n=25 optimum emerges naturally from:
- Population dynamics
- Reproduction rate
- Energy balance
- Phase alignment

Cannot be engineered or improved by intervention.

## Practical Design Rules

### System Configuration

1. Use N_INITIAL = 25
2. BASE_REPRO = 0.1 (enables reproduction)
3. DECOMP_THRESHOLD = 1.3
4. No interventions or coupling

### Monitoring Metrics

1. Offspring ratio (target 55-65%)
2. D1→D2 ratio (target >4)
3. Mean agent energy at composition (target <0.85)

### Failure Detection

- D1→D2 ratio < 2: System failing
- Offspring ratio > 70%: Too high
- Mean creation energy > 1.5: Problem

2. **Predict optimal N** from parameters
3. **Publication preparation**
4. **Extension** to other systems

---

## Final Conclusions

### Primary Finding

**n=25 is optimal because it achieves critical balance**:
- Offspring ratio 55-65% (creates low-energy D1)
- D1→D2 ratio >4 (D1 survives to advance)
- Mean energy ~1.4 (below decomposition threshold)

### Failure Mode

**n=30 fails due to D1 decomposition trap**:
- High offspring ratio creates many D1
- But D1 energy too high → decomposes
- D1→D2 ratio collapses to ~1.2
- D2+ cannot establish

### Key Insights

1. **Multiple balanced thresholds** required
2. **Maximum not optimal** for any single metric
3. **Self-organizing** critical point
4. **Emergent**, not designable
