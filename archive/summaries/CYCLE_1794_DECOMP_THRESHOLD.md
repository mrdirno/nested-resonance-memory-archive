# Cycle 1794: Decomposition Threshold Sensitivity

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1794
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

Tested if decomposition threshold (1.3) is special.

**FINDING: Pattern persists across all thresholds 1.1-1.6 - NOT threshold-dependent**

---

## Results

| Threshold | N=29 | N=35 | Diff |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| 1.1 | 60% | 100% | 40pp |
| 1.2 | 55% | 100% | 45pp |
| 1.3 | 55% | 95% | 40pp |
| 1.4 | 60% | 90% | 30pp |
| 1.5 | 55% | 100% | 45pp |
| 1.6 | 60% | 100% | 40pp |

## Analysis

### Pattern Persistence

The dead zone pattern persists across all tested thresholds.

Peak (N=29): 55-60% across all thresholds
Trough (N=35): 90-100% across all thresholds

Difference: 30-45 percentage points consistently.

### Structural Nature

The pattern is determined by:
- Initial population size (N)
- Pairing dynamics (resonance function)

NOT by:
- Decomposition threshold
- Specific parameter values

### Another Independence Result

This adds decomposition threshold to the list of 13+ parameters that don't affect the wavelength λ.

## Conclusions

1. **Threshold NOT special** - any value 1.1-1.6 works
2. **Pattern is structural** from composition dynamics
3. **Another parameter independence** confirmed
4. **14th parameter tested** with no effect
