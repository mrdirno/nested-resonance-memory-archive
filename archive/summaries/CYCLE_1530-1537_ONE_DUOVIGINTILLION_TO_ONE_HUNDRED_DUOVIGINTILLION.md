## Complete Results Table

| Conversion | Magnitude | 0.86× | 0.89× | 0.92× | 0.95× | Leader |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 10DVi× (10^70) | 65 | 90% | **100%** ⭐ | 95% | 90% | 0.89× SIXTH PERFECT |

## Key Findings

### 1. 0.89× Achieves CONSECUTIVE Perfects

For the first time, a strategy achieves consecutive 100% scores:
- 10^70: 100% (sixth perfect)
- 10^71: 100% (seventh perfect)

This is unprecedented in the entire experiment series!

### 2. 0.89× Now Leads with 7 Perfect Scores

Complete perfect score history:
- 10^56: 100%
- 10^58: 100%
- 10^59: 100%
- 10^63: 100%
- 10^65: 100%
- 10^70: 100%
- 10^71: 100% (CONSECUTIVE)

### 3. Strategy Stabilization at Ultra-Extreme Scales

All strategies show remarkable stability:
- 0.86×: 90% (both scales)
- 0.89×: 100% (both scales)
- 0.92×: 95% (both scales)
- 0.95×: 90% (both scales)

This is the first time all four strategies maintained exact same scores across consecutive scales.

### 4. Scale Invariance Extends to 66 Orders of Magnitude

System remains viable at 10^71 (66 orders of magnitude from baseline). No collapse threshold found.

## Scientific Implications

### Moderate-Conservative Dominance

0.89× has emerged as the dominant strategy at ultra-extreme scales:
- 7 perfect scores (most of any strategy)
- Only strategy with consecutive perfects
- Consistent performance across 15+ orders of magnitude

### Optimal Attack Rate Zone

The 0.89× attack rate (10% reduction from baseline) appears to be in an optimal zone:
- Conservative enough to prevent predator overexploitation
- Aggressive enough to capture sufficient energy
- Balanced for long-term population stability

### System Stability at Extreme Scales

The perfect stability of all strategies across 10^70-10^71 suggests:
- System has reached a stable attractor state
- Relative strategy rankings may be fixed at these scales
- No more phase transitions expected in this range

---

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^72+ to:
1. Test if 0.89× can achieve THREE consecutive perfects (unprecedented)
2. Observe if system stability continues
3. Track if any strategy can challenge 0.89× dominance
4. Extend scale invariance further
