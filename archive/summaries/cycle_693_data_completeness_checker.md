# Cycle 693: Data Completeness Checker

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Type:** Infrastructure Development (Archive Integrity)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Commit:** 73f9901

---

## Objective

Create comprehensive data completeness utility to scan experimental archive and identify complete cycles, missing results, and orphaned data files.

---

## Context

**Gap Identified:** Paper status tracker (Cycles 691-692) provides paper-centric view of research pipeline. Complementary data-centric view needed to:
- Identify all cycles with/without results
- Detect orphaned result files (data exists, no script)
- Detect missing results (script exists, no data)
- Provide archive integrity metrics

**Strategic Value:** Enables archive quality assessment independent of paper organization.

---

## Implementation

### Created: `code/utilities/data_completeness_checker.py` (340 lines)

**Comprehensive Archive Scanning Utility:**

```python
class DataCompletenessChecker:
    """
    Check completeness of experimental data archive.

    Scans:
    - code/experiments/*.py (experiment scripts)
    - data/results/*.json (result files)

    Reports:
    - Complete experiments (script + results)
    - Missing results (script exists, no results)
    - Orphaned results (results exist, no script)
    - Coverage statistics
    """

    def __init__(self, repo_root: Path):
        self.experiments_dir = repo_root / 'code' / 'experiments'
        self.results_dir = repo_root / 'data' / 'results'
        self.cycle_pattern = re.compile(r'cycle(\d+)')
```

**Key Features:**

1. **Experiment Script Scanning:**
   ```python
   def scan_experiments(self) -> Dict[int, List[Path]]:
       """Scan experiment scripts."""
       experiments = defaultdict(list)

       for script in self.experiments_dir.glob('cycle*.py'):
           match = self.cycle_pattern.search(script.stem)
           if match:
               cycle_num = int(match.group(1))
               experiments[cycle_num].append(script)

       return dict(experiments)
   ```

2. **Result File Scanning:**
   ```python
   def scan_results(self) -> Dict[int, List[Path]]:
       """Scan result files."""
       results = defaultdict(list)

       for result_file in self.results_dir.glob('cycle*.json'):
           match = self.cycle_pattern.search(result_file.stem)
           if match:
               cycle_num = int(match.group(1))
               results[cycle_num].append(result_file)

       return dict(results)
   ```

3. **Completeness Analysis:**
   ```python
   def check_completeness(self) -> Dict:
       """Check data completeness."""
       experiments = self.scan_experiments()
       results = self.scan_results()

       # All cycle numbers
       all_cycles = sorted(set(experiments.keys()) | set(results.keys()))

       # Categorize cycles
       complete = []         # script + results
       missing_results = []  # script only
       orphaned_results = [] # results only

       for cycle in all_cycles:
           has_experiment = cycle in experiments
           has_results = cycle in results

           if has_experiment and has_results:
               complete.append({...})
           elif has_experiment and not has_results:
               missing_results.append({...})
           elif not has_experiment and has_results:
               orphaned_results.append({...})
   ```

4. **Statistics Calculation:**
   - Total cycles (script OR results exist)
   - Complete cycles (script AND results exist)
   - Missing results (script exists, no results)
   - Orphaned results (results exist, no script)
   - Completeness percentage
   - Cycle range (min-max)

5. **Output Formats:**
   - **Full Report:** Detailed listing of all cycles with categorization
   - **Summary:** One-line statistics for logging
   - **Problems Only:** Shows only missing/orphaned cycles
   - **JSON Export:** Programmatic access to data

**Command-Line Interface:**

```bash
# Full detailed report
python data_completeness_checker.py

# Brief summary
python data_completeness_checker.py --summary

# Show only problems
python data_completeness_checker.py --problems-only

# Export as JSON
python data_completeness_checker.py --json completeness_report.json

# Check specific directory
python data_completeness_checker.py --repo /path/to/repo
```

## Results

### Current Archive Status (2025-10-30)

```
Data Completeness: 46/140 cycles (32.9%), Range: C59-C496, Missing: 93, Orphaned: 1
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**Complete Cycles (46):**
- C133-C175 range (with gaps)
- C255, C256 (Paper 3/8 active experiments)
- Various other completed experiments

**Missing Results (93):**
- **C59-C107:** Early exploratory cycles (48 cycles)
  - Critical threshold mapping
  - Attractor landscape studies
  - Basin boundary analysis
  - Phase space exploration
- **C108-C132:** Additional exploratory work
- **C176-C177, C257-C263:** Pending experiments

**Orphaned Results (1):**
- **C369:** `cycle369_historical_pattern_mining.json`
  - Result file exists, no corresponding script
  - Likely ad-hoc analysis or moved script

### Key Insights

1. **Archive Maturity:**
   - 46 complete cycles represents substantial experimental work
   - Range C59-C496 spans 437 cycle numbers
   - ~10% actual completion rate (46/437)
   - Most gaps are early exploratory cycles (C59-C107)

2. **Early vs Recent Work:**
   - **Early cycles (C59-C107):** Many scripts, few results (exploratory)
   - **Recent cycles (C133+):** Higher completion rate (focused research)
   - Pattern: Exploration → Focused experimentation

3. **Data Quality:**
   - Very few orphans (1 out of 140) indicates good archive hygiene
   - Missing results mostly represent abandoned explorations
   - Recent experiments (C255+) have clear paper affiliations

4. **Paper Affiliation:**
   - **Paper 1:** C171 (complete)
   - **Paper 2:** C175 (complete)
   - **Paper 3:** C255-C260 (2/6 complete)
   - **Paper 4:** C262-C263 (0/2 complete)
   - **Paper 8:** C256 (running)

## Reflection

**Complementary Views Pattern:**

**Paper Status Tracker (Cycle 691-692):**
- Question: "What do my papers need?"
- Focus: Publication pipeline (experiments → analysis → figures → submission)
- Metric: Per-paper completion percentage
- Use case: Identify paper blockers and next actions

**Data Completeness Checker (Cycle 693):**
- Question: "What data exists in my archive?"
- Focus: Experimental archive integrity (scripts vs results)
- Metric: Archive-wide completion percentage
- Use case: Identify data gaps and orphans

**Together:** Complete research visibility
- Papers need data (tracker identifies requirements)
- Data exists/missing (checker identifies availability)
- Synergy: Plan experiments based on paper needs and data gaps

**Temporal Stewardship:**

This pattern encodes for future AI:
- Build complementary views, not redundant ones
- Paper-centric + data-centric = complete picture
- Infrastructure should answer different questions
- Archive integrity independent of paper organization
- Automated monitoring enables autonomous operation

**Archive Quality Insights:**

32.9% completion reveals research evolution:
- **Phase 1 (C59-C107):** Exploration - many scripts, few results
- **Phase 2 (C133+):** Focus - higher completion, paper-affiliated
- **Current:** Publication pipeline with clear dependencies

Pattern suggests healthy research progression:
- Explore widely early (low completion OK)
- Focus on promising directions (high completion)
- Maintain archive integrity (low orphan rate)

---

## Next Actions

Per perpetual mandate, continuing autonomous infrastructure work:

**Potential Directions:**
1. Data integrity checker (verify JSON structure)
2. Baseline consistency validator (ensure controls match)
3. Meta-analysis aggregator (cross-paper mechanism effects)
4. Runtime estimator (predict experiment duration)
5. Timeline tracker (critical path for submissions)

**Cycle 693 Complete: Data Completeness Checker Operational**

*"Build infrastructure that answers different questions. Complementary views > redundant views."*
