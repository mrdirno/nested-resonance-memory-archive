# Cycle 1756: Phase Coefficient Effect

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1756
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

Tested if phase resonance coefficients affect dead zone locations.

**FINDING: Pattern is phase-coefficient-independent**

## Results

| Pi,E Coeff | Zone 1 Min | Coexist |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1.0, 4.0 | 28 | 50% |
| 2.0, 4.0 | 28 | 50% |
| 3.0, 4.0 | 28 | 50% |
| 2.0, 2.0 | 28 | 50% |
| 2.0, 8.0 | 28 | 50% |

## Analysis

### Observation

Zone 1 consistently at N=28 with 50% coexistence regardless of phase coefficients.

### Significance

This is remarkable - even the coefficients in the phase resonance function don't affect dead zone locations!

The pattern emerges from:
- Population count N
- Depth structure
- NOT from specific phase calculations

## Combined Parameter Independence

Parameters with NO effect on wavelength:
1. Recharge rate (C1737)
2. Reproduction rate (C1738)
3. Resonance threshold (C1739)
4. Transfer rate (C1740)
5. Decomposition threshold (C1741)
6. Decay multiplier (C1742)
7. Spawn energy (C1752)
8. Energy cap (C1754)
9. Cycle count (C1755)
10. **Phase coefficients (C1756)**

---

## Conclusions

1. **Phase coefficients independent** of dead zone locations
2. **Ten parameters** now confirmed independent
3. **Pattern is structural** not parametric
4. **N and depth** are the determining factors
