---

## Work Completed

### 1. Phase 1A Analysis Script (bcae4cd)

**File:** `code/experiments/analyze_cycle256_phase1a.py` (653 lines)

**Purpose:** Retrospective hypothesis testing on C256 runtime variance data.

**Statistical Methods:**
```python
# H1: System Resource Contention
def test_h1_resource_contention(runtimes, metadata):
    """Spearman correlation: CPU/memory vs runtime"""
    # Returns: correlation coefficient, p-value, significance

# H2: Memory Fragmentation
def test_h2_memory_fragmentation(runtimes, metadata):
    """Polynomial regression (degree 2): cumulative cycles vs runtime"""
    # Returns: R², coefficients, acceleration term, significance

# H3: I/O Accumulation
def test_h3_io_accumulation(runtimes, metadata):
    """Linear regression: DB size vs runtime"""
    # Returns: R², slope, intercept, significance

# H4: Thermal Throttling
def test_h4_thermal_throttling(runtimes, metadata):
    """Spearman correlation: CPU% proxy vs runtime"""
    # Returns: correlation coefficient, p-value, significance

# H5: Emergent Complexity
def test_h5_emergent_complexity(runtimes, metadata):
    """Linear regression: pattern count vs runtime"""
    # Returns: R², slope, intercept, significance
```

**Output:** JSON with tier ranking (expected: H2 > H5,H3 > H1,H4)

**Key Features:**
- Acceleration quantification (+2.5%/h → +3.6%/h over 34h)
- Non-linear growth characterization
- Temporal milestones (early: +49%, middle: +54%, late: +72%)
- Complete statistical validation pipeline

### 2. Phase 1B Analysis Script (4e8b9a6)

**File:** `code/experiments/analyze_cycle256_phase1b.py` (624 lines)

**Purpose:** Optimization comparison validation between C256 (unoptimized) and C257-C260 (optimized).

**Validation Tests:**
```python
# Test 1: Runtime Comparison
def compare_runtimes(c256, optimized_experiments):
    """
    Compare C256 (34.5h) vs C257-C260 (11-13 min).
    Predicted speedup: 160-190×
    """
    # Returns: speedup factor, within prediction flag, interpretation

# Test 2: Variance Elimination
def test_variance_elimination(c256, optimized_experiments):
    """
    Test if optimization eliminated runtime variance.
    Criterion: >50% reduction in CV and acceleration.
    """
    # Returns: CV reduction %, acceleration reduction %, validation status

# Test 3: Functional Equivalence
def test_functional_equivalence(c256, optimized_experiments):
    """
    Verify H1×H4 effects preserved after optimization.
    Ensures optimization doesn't alter behavior.
    """
    # Returns: correlation coefficient, preserved flag
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- **Strong validation:** All 3 tests pass (confirms H2+H3)
- **Moderate validation:** Tests 1+2 pass (speedup + variance elimination)
- **Weak validation:** 1 test passes (partial confirmation)
- **Rejected:** <1 test passes (H2+H3 not primary causes)

**Key Features:**
- 160-190× speedup prediction validation
- Variance elimination testing (H2+H3 mechanism confirmation)
- Functional equivalence verification
- Complete 3-dimensional validation
