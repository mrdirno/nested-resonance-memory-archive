## NARRATIVE TRANSFORMATION ACHIEVED

### Old Paper 2 (INVALID - Bug Artifacts)
**Title:** "From Bistability to Collapse: Energy Constraints and Three Dynamical Regimes"
**Regimes:** Bistability → Accumulation → Collapse
**Key Finding:** "Birth-death coupling leads to extinction"

### New Paper 2 V2 (VALIDATED - This Document)
**Title:** "Energy-Regulated Population Homeostasis and Timescale-Dependent Constraint Manifestation in Nested Resonance Memory"
**Regimes:** Bistability → Energy-Regulated Homeostasis (with timescale dependency)
**Key Finding:** "Energy-constrained spawning enables population homeostasis with non-monotonic timescale-dependent manifestation"

## NEXT CYCLE ACTIONS (Cycle 969)

**Priority 1: Insert Placeholder Content**
1. Copy sections 2.1-2.3 from existing PAPER2_REVISED_METHODS.md
2. Copy sections 3.1-3.2 from existing PAPER2_REVISED_RESULTS.md (with revisions for 3.2)
3. Copy section 4.1 from existing PAPER2_REVISED_DISCUSSION.md (with revisions)
4. Verify all cross-references updated
5. Check that narrative consistency maintained throughout

**Priority 2: Format for Submission**
1. Convert to DOCX using pandoc
2. Format for target journal (PLOS Computational Biology or PLOS ONE)
3. Embed figures (generate if needed, use 300 DPI)
4. Generate publication PDF
5. Create cover letter

**Priority 3: Final Review**
1. Proofread complete manuscript
2. Verify all citations properly formatted
3. Check figure captions complete
4. Validate statistical reporting
5. Ensure reproducibility documentation complete

## REVISED TIMELINE TO SUBMISSION

**Original Timeline (from Cycle 967):**
- Cycle 967: Planning (✅ completed)
- Cycle 968: Complete master source assembly (✅ IN PROGRESS → COMPLETE)
- Cycle 969: DOCX + figures
- Cycle 970: Submission

**Revised Timeline (updated for quality focus):**
- ✅ Cycle 967: Planning and strategy complete
- ✅ Cycle 968: Master source core assembly complete
- Cycle 969: Insert placeholder content (~850 lines), quality check
- Cycle 970: DOCX conversion, figure embedding, formatting
- Cycle 971: Final review, cover letter, submission

**Rationale for +1 cycle:** 6 placeholder sections need careful insertion with narrative consistency checks. Better to ensure quality than rush submission.
