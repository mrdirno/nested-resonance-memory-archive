# Cycle 1885: Asymmetry Mechanism

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1885
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

**Hypothesis FALSIFIED: Decomp/comp ratio higher BELOW Nc**

- Below Nc: ratio = 0.937
- Above Nc: ratio = 0.910
- Asymmetry not explained by decomposition rates

## Results

### Event Tracking

| N | Coex | Comps | Decomps | Ratio |
|---|------|-------|---------|-------|
| 12 | 86% | 242 | 231 | 0.942 |
| 13 | 54% | 203 | 190 | 0.902 |
| 14 | 40% | 155 | 141 | **0.874** |
| 15 | 60% | 169 | 154 | 0.890 |
| 16 | 84% | 195 | 180 | 0.911 |
| 17 | 100% | 205 | 189 | 0.920 |

### Key Finding

**Dead zone (N=14) has LOWEST decomp/comp ratio (0.874)**

---

## Falsified Hypothesis

**Original hypothesis:**
Systems above Nc have higher decomposition rates, leading to better D0 replenishment.

**Result:**
The opposite is true. Ratio is higher below Nc.

---

## Alternative Hypotheses

The asymmetry might be caused by:

1. **Absolute event counts**: More total events = more buffering
2. **Critical mass threshold**: Minimum population for stability
3. **Phase space coverage**: More agents = better depth distribution
4. **Stochastic effects**: Larger N = lower variance

---

## Implications

The asymmetric scaling (β_above > β_below) is NOT explained by decomposition dynamics.

Future research needed to identify the actual mechanism.

## Session Status (C1664-C1885)

222 cycles completed. Asymmetry hypothesis falsified.

Research continues.
