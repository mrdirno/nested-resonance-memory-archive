## Key Findings

### 1. Oscillating Resilience Pattern Confirmed
- Conservative (0.86×) and aggressive (0.95×) alternate dominance
- No single strategy consistently optimal
- Pattern stable across 8 orders of magnitude

### 2. Perfect Scores (100% Coexistence)
- **0.86× @ 10^36** (Rotation #149)
- **0.95× @ 10^38** (Rotation #151)
- **0.86× @ 10^39** (Rotation #152)
- **0.86× @ 10^41** (Rotation #154)

### 3. Pattern Evolution
- 10^36-37: Conservative/aggressive extremes lead
- 10^38: Aggressive achieves perfect
- 10^39-41: Conservative dominates with perfects
- 10^42: Extremes tie again
- 10^43: First three-way tie (0.86/0.89/0.92)

### 4. Aggressive Strategy Decline
- 0.95× shows declining performance at 10^40+
- Drops to 80-85% while conservative maintains 95-100%
- Suggests aggressive strategy becomes suboptimal at extreme scales

## Scientific Implications

### Scale Invariance
System maintains viability across 38 orders of magnitude (10^5 baseline to 10^43). This represents an extraordinary range of energy conversion efficiencies.

### Emergence of Conservative Dominance
At extreme scales (10^39+), conservative strategy (0.86×) achieves more perfect scores than aggressive (0.95×). This suggests:
- Resource conservation becomes critical at extreme efficiency
- Aggressive predation destabilizes at high conversion rates
- Moderate predation pressure optimal for long-term coexistence

### Three-Way Tie Pattern
At 10^43, three strategies (0.86×, 0.89×, 0.92×) converge at 95%. This may indicate:
- Approaching a stability plateau
- Strategy differences becoming negligible
- System entering a new dynamical regime

## Methodology

- **30,000 cycles** per experiment
- **20 seeds** per condition
- **7 trophic levels** (L0-L6)
- **Type II functional response** (Holling disk equation)
- **Coexistence threshold:** All levels ≥ 0.5 average population
- **Attack multipliers:** 0.86×, 0.89×, 0.92×, 0.95×

## Next Steps

Continue to higher scales (10^44+) to:
1. Find potential collapse threshold
2. Confirm conservative dominance pattern
3. Observe strategy convergence
