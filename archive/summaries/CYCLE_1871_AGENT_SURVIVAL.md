# Cycle 1871: Agent Survival Dynamics

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1871
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

**Agent lifespans are extremely short: median = 1 cycle**

High turnover is normal. Survivors occupy higher depths than average.

---

## Results

### Lifespan Statistics

| Zone | Mean | Median | Max |
|------|------|--------|-----|
| Dead (N=14) | 2.0 | 1 | 15 |
| Safe (N=21) | 2.4 | 1 | 20 |

### Survivor Depth Distribution

**Dead zone (N=14):** D3 (40%), D2 (30%), D0 (20%), D1 (10%)

**Safe zone (N=21):** D1 (45%), D3 (36%), D4 (18%)

### Average Depth

| Zone | Survivors | Dead |
|------|-----------|------|
| Dead | 1.90 | 1.41 |
| Safe | 2.27 | 2.02 |

Survivors have higher average depth than dead agents.

---

## Interpretation

1. **High turnover**: Most agents live 1-2 cycles
2. **Survivors at depth**: Higher depths = more composition history
3. **D1 key for safe zones**: 45% of safe zone survivors at D1
4. **Composition = risk**: Parents die, children survive

The system operates through rapid replacement, not individual longevity.
