# Cycle 1815: Inverted Pattern High N

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1815
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

Tested inverted pattern at N=70-120 (prob=0.35).

**CONFIRMED: Pattern completely attenuates above N=70**

---

## Results

| N | Coexistence |
|---|-------------|
| 70 | 97% |
| 75 | 93% |
| 80 | 93% |
| 85 | 87% |
| 90 | 90% |
| 95 | 83% |
| 100 | 97% |
| 105 | 93% |
| 110 | 97% |
| 115 | 97% |
| 120 | 80% |

Mean: 92%
Range: 80% - 97%

---

## Analysis

All N values 70-120 are safe in the inverted regime:
- No dead zones detected
- Mean coexistence 92%
- Minimal variation (17pp spread)

### Confirmed Range

**Inverted pattern (prob ≥ 0.35): N = 20-70**

Compare to original pattern: N = 15-150

The inverted pattern has less than half the effective range.

---

## Implications

### Practical Design

For N > 70:
- Reproduction probability doesn't matter
- All N values safe in both regimes
- No dead zone avoidance needed

### Pattern Mechanism

The inverted (reproduction-dominated) mechanism:
- Creates fewer interference effects
- Affects only small populations
- Rapid population growth masks phase resonance

---

## Conclusions

1. **Inverted pattern disappears above N=70**
2. **All high N values safe (80-97%)**
3. **Original pattern range 2× longer**
4. **N > 70 is universally safe**
