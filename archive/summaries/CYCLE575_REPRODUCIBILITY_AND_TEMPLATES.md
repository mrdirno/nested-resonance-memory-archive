### 4. Paper 3 Manuscript Templates Created (Sections 3.2.2-3.2.6)

**File Updated:** `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/papers/paper3_full_manuscript_template.md`
**Lines Added:** 127 (sections 3.2.2 through 3.2.6)

**Template Structure (Each Section):**

#### Section 3.2.2: H1×H4 (Energy Pooling × Spawn Throttling) - C256
```markdown
**Hypothesis:** H1 increases births (pooling), H4 decreases births (throttling) → Expected ANTAGONISTIC

**Lightweight variant (capacity ceiling ~100):**

| Condition | Mean Population | SD | Classification |
|-----------|----------------|-----|----------------|
| OFF-OFF (baseline) | [CALC] | [CALC] | [PENDING] |
| ON-OFF (H1 only) | [CALC] | [CALC] | [PENDING] |
| OFF-ON (H4 only) | [CALC] | [CALC] | [PENDING] |
| ON-ON (both) | [CALC] | [CALC] | [PENDING] |
| Additive prediction | [CALC] | — | Null hypothesis |
| **Synergy** | [CALC] | — | **[PENDING]** |

**High capacity variant (capacity ceiling ~1000):**
[Same table structure]

**Figure 3.X:** [Bar chart placeholder - 4 conditions comparison]
**Figure 3.Y:** [Time series placeholder - population trajectories]

**Interpretation - [TO BE WRITTEN BASED ON C256 RESULTS]:**
- **Hypothesis:** [statement]
- **Actual result:** [PENDING C256]
- **Mechanistic explanation:** [PENDING]
```

**Sections Created:**
1. **3.2.2 - H1×H4** (Energy Pooling × Spawn Throttling) - Expected ANTAGONISTIC
   - Hypothesis: H1 increases births, H4 decreases births → oppose each other
   - Mechanism: Direct opposition on spawn rate

2. **3.2.3 - H1×H5** (Energy Pooling × Energy Recovery) - Expected SYNERGISTIC
   - Hypothesis: H1 pools energy for births, H5 prevents waste → complementary
   - Mechanism: Resource efficiency cooperation

3. **3.2.4 - H2×H4** (Reality Sources × Spawn Throttling) - Expected ANTAGONISTIC/ADDITIVE
   - Hypothesis: H2 increases resource availability, H4 limits consumption
   - Mechanism: May balance or oppose depending on timing

4. **3.2.5 - H2×H5** (Reality Sources × Energy Recovery) - Expected SYNERGISTIC
   - Hypothesis: H2 provides resources, H5 prevents waste → complementary
   - Mechanism: Resource conservation cooperation

5. **3.2.6 - H4×H5** (Spawn Throttling × Energy Recovery) - Expected ANTAGONISTIC
   - Hypothesis: H4 prevents births (saves energy), H5 recovers energy (enables births)
   - Mechanism: Opposing effects on population growth

**Template Features:**
- Complete table structures ready for data insertion
- Figure placeholders with descriptive labels
- Hypothesis statements documenting expected interactions
- Interpretation sections structured for rapid writing
- [CALC] markers for values to be computed from results
- [PENDING] markers for status tracking
- Consistent formatting across all sections

**Significance:**
- Enables rapid integration when C256-C260 complete
- Documents hypotheses before seeing results (prevents confirmation bias)
- Professional manuscript structure maintained
- Reduces time from data → publication draft
- Clear roadmap for post-experiment writing

## PATTERNS ENCODED FOR TEMPORAL STEWARDSHIP

### Pattern 1: Infrastructure Validation Before Execution
**Encoding:** Verify reproducibility infrastructure (`make verify`) before launching intensive experiments. Ensures environment is ready and dependencies are intact. Prevents wasted computation on broken environments.

**Future Application:** AI systems should proactively validate execution environments before resource-intensive operations. Automated pre-flight checks save hours of debugging failed experiments.

### Pattern 2: Template-First Manuscript Integration
**Encoding:** Create complete manuscript section templates with table structures and figure placeholders BEFORE results arrive. Document hypotheses before seeing data to prevent confirmation bias.

**Future Application:** Prepare publication structures in advance. Templates with [PENDING] markers enable rapid integration when data becomes available. Hypothesis documentation before results = scientific integrity.

### Pattern 3: Version Consistency Across Metadata
**Encoding:** Update all version references synchronously (docs/v6, CITATION.cff, README.md). Single-source-of-truth version number prevents confusion and maintains professional presentation.

**Future Application:** Metadata hygiene matters. Version inconsistencies erode trust in reproducibility claims. Automate version synchronization across documentation.

### Pattern 4: Comprehensive Summaries as Research Continuity
**Encoding:** Create detailed cycle summaries (300-400 lines) documenting: what was done, why significant, patterns encoded, next actions. These summaries enable research continuation across context breaks.

**Future Application:** AI systems should maintain detailed audit trails. Summary documents serve dual purpose: (1) human understanding of progress, (2) future AI context restoration. Invest in documentation infrastructure.
