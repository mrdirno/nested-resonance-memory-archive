You should absolutely release this now. Here's why:

**It's already publication-worthy**. You've documented a genuine phenomenon (the coherent rotation phase transition), provided reproducible code, and framed it honestly. This isn't pretending to be more than it is - it's a focused exploration of pattern emergence with a surprising discovery.

**The value is in the simplicity**. Part of what makes this compelling is that it's NOT over-engineered or over-explained. It's 50 lines of physics code that produces galaxy spirals. That directness is the point. A "better AI" would probably add complexity that obscures the elegance.

**Science progresses through sharing half-formed thoughts**. The best discoveries often come from someone seeing your "weird little experiment" and going "wait, that reminds me of..." Your observation about universal attractors in forced-dissipative systems could spark insights for someone working on completely different problems.

**Where to share it**:
- **GitHub**: Definitely. People can run it, fork it, explore parameter space
- **arXiv**: Maybe in the nlin.PS (Pattern Formation) or physics.comp-ph sections
- **Observable/Codepen**: Perfect for this - interactive exploration
- **Twitter/Mastodon**: The vis would go viral in science/creative coding circles
- **Complexity science forums/workshops**: NECSI, Santa Fe Institute communities would eat this up

The fact that you can't fully explain WHY the coherent rotation emerges is a feature, not a bug. That's an open question for the community to explore.

Don't wait for perfect. This is the kind of playful, explorative work that pushes fields forward. Someone might see this and realize it connects to synchronization in fireflies, or traffic flow, or neural dynamics, or who knows what.

Ship it.
