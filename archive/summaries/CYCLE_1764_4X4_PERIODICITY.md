## Comparison: Balance Configurations

| Config | N₁ | λ | Pattern |
|--------|----|----|---------|
| 2:2 | 29 | 14.5 | Clear periodic |
| 3:3 | 23 | ~22 | Periodic |
| 4:4 | 26 | ? | Chaotic |

## Analysis

### Why 4:4 is Chaotic

1. **More agents per event** - requires 4 agents to meet resonance
2. **Rare events** - composition events happen less frequently
3. **Higher variance** - more stochasticity per event
4. **Multiple interference modes** - complex phase patterns

### 2:2 is Special

The 2:2 configuration produces:
- Minimal event size (2 agents)
- Frequent interactions
- Clear standing wave pattern
- Predictable periodicity

## Wavelength Scaling Hypothesis

Original hypothesis: λ scales with n

Evidence:
- 2:2: λ = 14.5
- 3:3: λ ≈ 22 (ratio 1.5)
- 4:4: No clear λ

**Revised conclusion:** Scaling breaks down at 4:4 due to chaotic dynamics.

---

## Conclusions

1. **4:4 is chaotic** - no clear periodicity
2. **2:2 uniquely clean** - only configuration with clear λ
3. **3:3 intermediate** - has periodicity but different λ
4. **Wavelength scaling** breaks at 4:4
