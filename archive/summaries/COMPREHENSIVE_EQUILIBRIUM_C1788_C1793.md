**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycles:** C1788-C1793 (6 cycles)

## Executive Summary

Deep analysis of equilibrium states revealed critical insights about system structure, energy dynamics, and predictive metrics.

### Key Discoveries

1. **Time Dynamics** - Fate determined by cycles 1-7
2. **D3 Dominance** - Stable accumulator due to low energy
3. **N Scaling** - 11-15% survival, oscillates with λ
4. **Energy Stratification** - D3 low (0.6), D4 high (1.2)
5. **D3/D4 Ratio** - Threshold <5 for healthy coexistence

## Cycle-by-Cycle Summary

### C1788: Time Dynamics
- Systems stabilize by cycles 1-7
- Fate determined by initial composition cascade
- Can't rescue poorly configured systems

### C1789: Population Distributions
- D3 dominates all equilibria (1.5-8.2 agents)
- D4 secondary (0.6-2.1 agents)
- D0-D2 sparse (0-1 each)
- Coexistence = D3 + D4

### C1790: N vs D3 Scaling
- D3 ≈ 0.048×N + 1.29
- Ratio oscillates with λ ≈ 15
- Dead zones → more D3 accumulation

### C1791: Total Population
- 11-15% of initial N survives
- Dead zones = more agents, fewer depths
- Safe zones = fewer agents, more depths

### C1792: Energy Distribution
- D3 energy: 0.59-0.63 (stable)
- D4 energy: 1.14-1.18 (cycling)
- D3 << decomposition threshold (1.3)
- D4 ≈ threshold (constant decomposition)

### C1793: D3/D4 Ratio
- Ratio < 5 for healthy coexistence
- Dead zones: ratio 6-21
- Safe zones: ratio < 3
- Useful monitoring metric

## Complete Equilibrium Picture

### Structure

```
Level   Energy    Role              Population
─────   ──────    ────              ──────────
D4      ~1.2      Cycling partner   Secondary
D3      ~0.6      Stable accumulator Primary (dominant)
D2      ~1.2      Transit           Sparse
D1      ~0.9      Transit           Sparse
D0      ~0.6      Depleted          Empty/Sparse
```

### Dynamics

1. Initial population cascades to D4
2. D4 decomposes to D3 (high energy)
3. D3 accumulates (low energy can't decompose)
4. D3/D4 cycle maintains system

### Coexistence Conditions

- D3/D4 ratio < 5 (threshold)
- Both D3 and D4 occupied
- Balanced cycling flow

## Practical Metrics

### Monitoring Indicators

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| D3/D4 ratio | <3 | 3-5 | >5 |
| Total agents | 5-15% of N | <5% | <2% |
| Depths occupied | ≥3 | 2 | 1 |

### Design Verification

After configuring N:
1. Run for 10 cycles
2. Check D3/D4 ratio
3. If ratio > 5, reconfigure N
