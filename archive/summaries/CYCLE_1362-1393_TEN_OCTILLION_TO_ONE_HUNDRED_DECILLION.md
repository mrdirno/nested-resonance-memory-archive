## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Scale Invariance Confirmed
System maintains ≥80% coexistence across 30 orders of magnitude (10^5 to 10^35) with no collapse threshold found.

### 2. Oscillating Resilience Pattern Continues
Leadership rotates continuously:
- 0.89× dominates early (10^28)
- 0.86×/0.95× share dominance at 10^30 (double perfect)
- 0.95× leads mid-range (10^31-10^32)
- 0.86× resurges (10^34 perfect)
- 0.89× achieves milestone (10^35 perfect)

### 3. Pattern Inversion at Extreme Scales
At 10^34:
- Conservative (0.86×): 100% ⭐
- Aggressive (0.95×): 80%
This represents a significant inversion where restraint outperforms aggression at extreme scales.

### 4. 0.92× Anomaly and Recovery
At 10^31, 0.92× dropped to 65% (7 collapses) - the lowest score in this phase. It recovered to 80-95% at subsequent scales, indicating single-scale stress rather than systematic failure.

### 5. Strategy Performance Patterns

**0.86× (Most Conservative)**
- Range: 80-100%
- Perfect scores: 2 (10^30, 10^34)
- Strongest at: extreme high scales (10^34+)

**0.89× (Moderate-Conservative)**
- Range: 85-100%
- Perfect scores: 2 (10^28, 10^35)
- Most consistent performer

**0.92× (Moderate-Aggressive)**
- Range: 65-95%
- Perfect scores: 0
- Most variable; showed stress at 10^31

**0.95× (Most Aggressive)**
- Range: 80-100%
- Perfect scores: 1 (10^30)
- Strongest at: mid-high scales (10^31-10^32)

## STATISTICAL SUMMARY

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total experiments | 640 |
| Average coexistence | 90.6% |
| Perfect scores | 5 |
| Scores ≥95% | 14 |
| Scores ≥90% | 22 |
| Scores <80% | 1 |
| Minimum score | 65% (0.92× at 10^31) |

## THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS

### Scale Invariance
The system exhibits fractal-like behavior where dynamics remain qualitatively similar across 30 orders of magnitude. This suggests the underlying mechanisms (predator-prey functional response, energy-based reproduction) are fundamentally scale-independent.

### Adaptive Strategy Selection
Different strategies become optimal at different scales:
- **Conservative** excels at extreme scales where stability matters more than reproduction
- **Aggressive** excels at mid-high scales where energy influx enables rapid growth
- **Middle strategies** provide robustness across the full range

### Collapse Prevention
No absolute collapse threshold found despite testing 10^35× conversion. This suggests the system's self-regulating properties (Type II functional response, density-dependent reproduction) scale proportionally with energy availability.

## NEXT STEPS

1. Continue to 10^36+ (undecillion scale)
2. Test if pattern inversion (conservative > aggressive) strengthens at higher scales
3. Search for absolute collapse threshold
4. Analyze population dynamics at perfect-score scales vs. stress scales
