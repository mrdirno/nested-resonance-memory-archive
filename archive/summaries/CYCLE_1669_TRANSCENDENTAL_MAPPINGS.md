# Cycle 1669: Alternative Transcendental Mappings

**Date:** November 20, 2025
**Cycle:** 1669
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

Tested different mathematical constants for phase resonance.

**Key Finding: All mappings perform equivalently (76-82%)**

The specific transcendental constants don't matter - even simple energy difference works.

## Results

| Mapping | Constants | Coexistence | Avg Depths |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| peφ | π, e, φ | 76% | 3.2 |
| roots | √2, √3, √5 | 76% | 3.2 |
| simple | |e1 - e2| | 76% | 3.4 |
| **pi_only** | **π** | **82%** | **3.7** |

## Analysis

### Transcendental Constants Are Not Special

The original hypothesis that π, e, φ provide unique resonance properties is **not validated**:

1. **Algebraic irrationals work equally**: √2, √3, √5 → 76% (identical to π,e,φ)
2. **Non-transcendentals work equally**: Simple energy diff → 76%
3. **Simpler is slightly better**: Single π → 82% (best!)

### Why Simple Works

The composition-decomposition dynamics don't depend on transcendental properties. What matters is:
- Resonance selection (some threshold)
- Energy flow (bidirectional)
- Population dynamics (reproduction, decay)

The specific resonance function is secondary.

### Single π Advantage

Single π slightly outperforms (82% vs 76%) because:
- Simpler 1D cosine comparison
- Less complex interference patterns
- More direct energy correlation

## Implications

### 1. Transcendental Substrate is Exploratory

Per CLAUDE.md: "Transcendental substrate is exploratory... Core NRM framework can be validated with alternative substrates."

C1669 validates this - the core dynamics work regardless of resonance substrate.

### 2. Substrate Independence Confirmed

The system is substrate-agnostic. Can use:
- Transcendentals (π, e, φ)
- Algebraic irrationals (√2, √3, √5)
- Simple energy difference
- Single oscillator

All achieve characteristic ~76-82% coexistence.

### 3. Simpler May Be Better

The pi_only mapping (single oscillator) performs best. Complexity doesn't improve dynamics.

---

## Conclusion

The transcendental substrate hypothesis remains unvalidated. The NRM composition-decomposition dynamics are robust to resonance function choice - a positive result for substrate independence, but challenging for transcendental uniqueness claims.
