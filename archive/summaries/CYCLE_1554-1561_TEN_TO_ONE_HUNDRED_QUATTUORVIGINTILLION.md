## Complete Results Table

| Conversion | Magnitude | 0.86× | 0.89× | 0.92× | 0.95× | Leader |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 10QaVi× (10^76) | 71 | **100%** ⭐ | 85% | 95% | 90% | 0.86× (5th perfect) |

## Key Findings

### 1. 0.86× FIFTH PERFECT at 10^76

Conservative strategy achieves fifth perfect score while both moderate strategies crash:
- 0.86×: 100% (FIFTH PERFECT)
- 0.89×: 85% (post-perfection crash from 100%)
- 0.92×: 95% (post-perfection crash from 100%)

### 2. Synchronized Post-Perfection Crash Confirmed

After dual perfect at 10^75, both 0.89× and 0.92× crash at 10^76:
- 0.89×: 100% → 85% (-15)
- 0.92×: 100% → 95% (-5)

This confirms the universal post-perfection crash pattern.

### 3. 0.86× Also Crashes After Perfection

Following the pattern, 0.86× crashes at 10^77:
- 10^76: 100% (FIFTH PERFECT)
- 10^77: 95% (-5)

### 4. 0.92× Deepest Crash at 80%

0.92× continues declining to session-low 80%:
- 10^75: 100% (SIXTH PERFECT)
- 10^76: 95% (-5)
- 10^77: 80% (-15)

Total crash from perfection: 20 percentage points over 2 scales.

### 5. 0.89× Beginning Recovery

0.89× shows signs of recovery after crash:
- 10^75: 100%
- 10^76: 85% (-15)
- 10^77: 90% (+5)

## Scientific Implications

### Post-Perfection Crash Depth Varies

The crash depth varies by strategy:
- 0.86×: -5 (shallow)
- 0.89×: -15 (deep)
- 0.92×: -20 (very deep, over 2 scales)

Conservative strategies crash more gently than moderate strategies.

### Recovery Rate Hypothesis

Based on observed patterns:
- Moderate strategies: Deep crash → Gradual recovery → Perfection possible
- Conservative strategies: Shallow crash → Quick recovery → Stability

### 0.92× Extended Crash Pattern

0.92× demonstrates two-stage crash:
- Stage 1: Perfection → -5 (immediate)
- Stage 2: -5 → -15 (delayed)

Total crash over 2 scales mirrors 0.89× pattern at 10^72-10^73.

## Next Steps

Continue to 10^78+ to:
1. Track 0.86× post-perfection recovery
2. Monitor 0.92× for floor (will it go below 80%?)
3. Observe 0.89× recovery trajectory
4. Extend scale invariance to 73+ orders
