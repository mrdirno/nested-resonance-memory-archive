## Analysis

### Peak Location
- Peak integrated autocorrelation: N=14
- Critical point: Nc=15
- Difference: 1 (within error)

### Implications

1. **Second-order transition confirmed**
   - Critical slowing down is characteristic signature
   - Dynamics slow near critical point
   - Fluctuations persist longer

2. **Recovery time maximized at Nc**
   - System takes longest to relax at critical point
   - This explains difficulty of escape from dead zone

3. **Connection to scaling laws**
   - τ_int ~ |N - Nc|^(-z×ν)
   - Dynamical critical exponent z may be extracted

---

## Theoretical Significance

Critical slowing down connects NRM to universality class:
- Percolation?
- Contact process?
- Directed percolation?

The phase transition is NOT first-order (discontinuous).
It is second-order (continuous) with critical dynamics.

## New Principle

### PRIN-CRITICAL-DYNAMICS

Near the dead zone center, system dynamics slow down.
Integrated autocorrelation time peaks at Nc.
This is characteristic of second-order phase transitions.
