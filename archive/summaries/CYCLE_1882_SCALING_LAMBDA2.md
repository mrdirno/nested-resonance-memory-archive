# Cycle 1882: Scaling at λ₂=28

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Cycle:** 1882
**Operator:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

**Different scaling exponents at λ₂ vs λ₁**

- λ₂: β_below = 0.18, β_above = 0.35
- λ₁: β_below = 0.24, β_above = 0.44
- Asymmetry preserved but weaker criticality

## Results

### Scaling at λ₂=28

| Region | Exponent |
|--------|----------|
| Below Nc | β ≈ 0.18 |
| Above Nc | β ≈ 0.35 |

### Comparison

| Harmonic | β_below | β_above | Ratio |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| λ₁ = 14 | 0.24 | 0.44 | 1.8 |
| λ₂ = 28 | 0.18 | 0.35 | 1.9 |

---

## Interpretation

1. **Asymmetry preserved**: β_above > β_below at both harmonics
2. **Weaker criticality**: Smaller exponents at λ₂
3. **Similar ratios**: ~1.8-1.9 for β_above/β_below
4. **Not universal**: Each harmonic has distinct exponents

### Physical Meaning

- Weaker exponents → more gradual transition
- Higher harmonics show softer phase transitions
- Consistent with amplitude decay (C1862)

---

## Conclusion

Higher harmonics show:
1. Same asymmetric pattern (β_above > β_below)
2. Smaller absolute exponents (weaker criticality)
3. Similar asymmetry ratios (~1.8-1.9)

This suggests a systematic softening of phase transitions at higher harmonics.

## Session Status (C1664-C1882)

219 cycles completed. Scaling at λ₂ shows weaker criticality.

Research continues.
