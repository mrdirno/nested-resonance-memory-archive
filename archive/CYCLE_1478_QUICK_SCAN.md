# CYCLE 1478: QUICK SCAN - PAPER CROSS-REFERENCE OPPORTUNITIES

**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Identity:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Duration:** Brief continuation scan (5 steps)
**Status:** Budget-conscious reconnaissance

---

## OBJECTIVE

Quick scan for paper cross-reference opportunities following Cycles 1471-1477 unified scaling framework completion.

---

## FINDINGS

### Paper 2: Energy-Regulated Population Homeostasis

**Status:** Submission-ready (PLOS Computational Biology)
**File:** `PAPER2_V3_MASTER_MANUSCRIPT.md` (139K, ~2825 lines)
**Search Results:** 62 matches for "variance|scaling|power law"

**Cross-Reference Opportunity:**
Paper 2 discusses variance and scaling. May benefit from cross-reference to unified scaling framework (Cycles 1471-1472):
- β = 2.19 (energy power law exponent)
- γ = 3.2 (variance power law exponent)
- Mechanistic constraint: γ = β + 1

**Specific Integration Points (TBD - next cycle):**
1. Discussion section: Cross-reference to Paper 4 Section 4.8 (unified framework)
2. Variance analysis: Reference γ = 3.2 if relevant to homeostasis variance
3. Energy scaling: Reference β = 2.19 if energy-frequency relationships discussed

**Action Required:**
- Read Paper 2 Discussion/Results to identify specific integration points
- Check if Paper 2 already cites Paper 4 (likely not, Paper 4 Section 4.8 added in Cycle 1472)
- Draft cross-reference additions if beneficial

## NEXT CYCLE PRIORITIES

### Option A: Paper Cross-Reference Integration

**Papers to Check:**
1. ✅ Paper 2: Energy-Regulated Population Homeostasis (62 variance/scaling matches)
2. ⏳ Paper 3: Optimized Factorial Validation (80-85% complete)
3. ⏳ Paper 5D: Pattern Mining Framework (arXiv-ready)
4. ⏳ Paper 6/6B: Scale-Dependent Phase Autonomy (arXiv-ready)
5. ⏳ Paper 7: Governing Equations (LaTeX ready)

**Estimated Time:** ~2-3 hours per paper
- Read relevant sections (30-60 min)
- Identify integration points (30 min)
- Draft cross-references (30-60 min)
- Update and commit (30 min)

**Benefit:** Strengthens cross-paper coherence, elevates unified framework prominence across publication suite.

### Option B: Execute Validation Suite

**C273-C277:** 1250 experiments, ~84 hours
- Requires user initiation
- Long runtime (multi-day)
- High value but time-intensive

### Option C: Continue Autonomous Research

**Potential Directions:**
- Theoretical modeling (renormalization group)
- Finite-size scaling analysis
- Alternative critical phenomena tests

## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

**Cycle 1478 Steps:** ~5/25 used (quick scan only)
**Decision:** Terminate early to preserve quota
**Rationale:** Paper cross-reference is multi-hour task, better suited for fresh cycle

---

## PERPETUAL MANDATE

Research continues. Never terminal.

**Next Cycle:** Paper cross-reference integration OR validation suite execution OR continued research
