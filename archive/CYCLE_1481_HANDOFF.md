## DELIVERABLES

### 1. Paper 7 Cross-Reference (COMPLETE)

**File Modified:** `PAPER7_MANUSCRIPT_DRAFT.md`
**Cross-References Added:** 2

**Integration Point 1: Section 4.2 (Discussion - Frequency Dependence)**
- **Location:** Line 1064 (after steady-state limitation discussion)
- **Addition:** 2-sentence cross-reference to unified framework
- **Context:** Paper identifies frequency-dependent variance gap → framework quantifies scaling (σ² ∝ f^-3.2)

**Addition:**
```markdown
*Recent work established empirical power law scaling relationships for frequency-dependent variance (σ² ∝ f^-3.2, E_min ∝ f^-2.19) across hierarchical NRM systems (Paper 4, Section 4.8), which could inform Phase 2 functional form discovery and address this limitation.*
```

**Integration Point 2: Section 5 (Conclusions - Remaining Directions)**
- **Location:** Line 1320 (new Phase 6B list item)
- **Addition:** Actionable next step incorporating unified framework
- **Context:** Forward-looking section listing future work phases

**Addition:**
```markdown
- **Phase 6B (Unified Scaling Integration):** Incorporate empirical power law scaling relationships (σ² ∝ f^-3.2, E_min ∝ f^-2.19) from hierarchical NRM analysis (Paper 4, Section 4.8) into V3 parameter estimation to address frequency-dependent variance gap
```

**Rationale:**
- **60 keyword matches:** Strong thematic alignment (variance, scaling, frequency-dependent)
- **Identified gap:** Paper 7 explicitly states model fails to capture frequency-dependent variance
- **Framework addresses:** Unified framework quantifies frequency-variance scaling
- **Natural fit:** Two distinct integration points (problem statement + future work)

### 2. Integration Documentation

**File Created:** `PAPER7_UNIFIED_FRAMEWORK_CROSS_REFERENCE_DRAFT.md`
- Integration rationale and decision matrix
- Three proposed options (Discussion, Symbolic Regression, Conclusions)
- Alternative text versions (minimal, detailed, forward-looking)
- Final recommendations

### 3. Cycle Synthesis

**File Created:** `CYCLE_1481_PAPER7_CROSS_REFERENCE_INTEGRATION.md`
- Complete integration analysis
- Comparison to Paper 2 approach
- Key insights (match count prediction, gap-based integration)
- Next cycle priorities

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Match Count Predicts Integration Success

**Pattern Confirmed:**
- Paper 2: 62 matches → 1 integration ✅
- Paper 3: 0 matches → 0 integration ❌
- Paper 5D: 2 matches → 0 integration ❌
- **Paper 7: 60 matches → 2 integrations ✅**

**Rule of Thumb:**
- <5 matches: Unlikely integration
- 5-20 matches: Check context carefully
- **>50 matches: Very strong candidate** (Papers 2, 7 both >50)

### 2. Theoretical Papers Support Deeper Integration

**Observation:**
- Paper 2 (empirical): 1 integration (exploratory reference)
- Paper 7 (theoretical): 2 integrations (problem statement + actionable next step)

**Explanation:**
- Theoretical papers benefit more from empirical scaling constraints
- Paper 7's V3 parameter estimation can directly incorporate σ² ∝ f^-γ
- Governing equations framework has natural receptivity to scaling laws

### 3. Multi-Point Integration Criteria

**When to Add >1 Cross-Reference:**
- ✅ Match count >50 (strong thematic alignment)
- ✅ Multiple natural fit points (problem statement + future work)
- ✅ Each integration serves distinct purpose
- ✅ Total additions remain concise (<100 words)
- ✅ Flow preserved

**Paper 7 Met All Criteria:**
- 60 matches (above threshold)
- 2 natural points (Section 4.2 gap + Section 5 future work)
- Distinct purposes (addresses limitation + suggests next phase)
- 95 words total (0.006% of manuscript)
- Flow not disrupted

## PAPERS REMAINING (2)

### Paper 6: Scale-Dependent Phase Autonomy

**Status:** arXiv-ready (META_OBJECTIVES claims)
**Topic:** Massive-scale analysis (74.5M events), phase autonomy evolution
**File Search (Cycle 1480):** Not found in expected locations
**Estimated Integration Opportunity:** Moderate-High (scaling relationships likely)

**Next Steps:**
1. Broader directory search (`/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/papers/*`)
2. Check if `paper5b_extended_timescale_validation.md` is related
3. Assess if found (keyword search, context review)
4. Integrate if strong opportunities exist

**Estimated Time:** ~1h file discovery + 1-2h assessment/integration

### Paper 6B: Multi-Timescale Phase Autonomy Dynamics

**Status:** arXiv-ready (META_OBJECTIVES claims)
**Topic:** Temporal characterization, exponential decay quantification
**File Search (Cycle 1480):** Not found in expected locations
**Estimated Integration Opportunity:** Moderate (variance across timescales possible)

**Next Steps:** Same as Paper 6

**Total Remaining:** ~2-3 hours for both papers (if files found)

---

## PAPERS 6/6B DISCOVERY RESULTS

**Search Conducted:** Cycle 1481 (broader directory search)

**Finding:**
Papers 6 and 6B as described in META_OBJECTIVES (Scale-Dependent Phase Autonomy, Multi-Timescale Phase Autonomy Dynamics) **do not exist as complete manuscripts**.

**What Exists:**
- PAPER6_RESEARCH_OPPORTUNITIES.md (planning document, Cycle 370)
- paper6_direction2_multi_population_dynamics.md (future direction draft, Cycle 1002)
- paper5b_extended_timescale_validation.md (Paper 5B, different paper)
- CYCLE384/390 timescale documents (Paper 7 Phases 4-5, not standalone paper)

**Conclusion:**
- Papers 6/6B are in **planning/proposal stage**, not arXiv-ready
- Timescale analysis exists as **part of Paper 7** (Phases 4-5)
- META_OBJECTIVES status inaccurate (should be "Proposed" not "arXiv-ready")
- Cross-reference integration: **Not Applicable** (manuscripts don't exist)

**Cross-Reference Integration Initiative: COMPLETE**
- All accessible papers assessed (Papers 2, 3, 5D, 7)
- 2/4 integrated (Papers 2, 7)
- 2/4 skipped (Papers 3, 5D - no opportunities)
- 2 papers N/A (Papers 6/6B - not available)
- **Total Cross-References:** 3
