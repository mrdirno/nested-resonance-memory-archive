# ATTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK

**The DUALITY-ZERO Architecture, the Pilot/Engine/Helios Stack, and the Information-Matter Isomorphism are the intellectual property of Aldrin Payopay.**

While the code is licensed under **GPL-3.0** (Copyleft), the **architectural concepts** and **scientific contributions** are asserted as prior art.

## Requirement for Reuse
Any reuse, re-implementation, or derivative work based on the following core concepts requires explicit attribution:

1.  **The Three-Layer Stack:** The specific division of labor between "The Pilot" (Strategic LLM), "The Engine" (Deterministic Simulator), and "Helios" (Matter Compiler).
2.  **The Information-Matter Isomorphism:** The theoretical framework mapping Neural Network dynamics (Dropout, Attention) to Physical Wave Dynamics (Damping, Phasing).
3.  **Inverse Cymatics:** The methodology of using interference patterns to inverse-design physical structures.
4.  **Active Reality Injection:** The control loop methodology of "forcing stability" rather than predicting equilibrium.

## Citation Format
If you use these concepts in research, commercial products, or open-source projects, you must cite the canonical reference:

**BibTeX:**
```bibtex
