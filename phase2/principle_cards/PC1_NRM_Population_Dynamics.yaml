principle:
  statement: >
    Self-organizing computational systems exhibiting emergent population dynamics
    can be rigorously validated through four complementary gates: analytical prediction
    (SDE/Fokker-Planck), state classification (regime detection), reproducibility
    enforcement (cryptographic validation), and reality authentication (computational
    expense prediction). This validation framework generalizes beyond NRM to any
    system requiring falsifiable predictions, automated state assessment, deterministic
    execution, and grounding verification.
