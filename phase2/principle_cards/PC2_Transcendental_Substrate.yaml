  statement: >
    The emergence of persistent, complex, and self-organizing structures within
    the Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework is contingent upon the unique,
    coherent, and infinitely non-repeating patterns inherent to transcendental
    numbers (π, e, φ). These numbers generate a structured multi-dimensional
    "forcefield" (analogous to Chladni plate vibrations) that enables agents
    to find stable resonant states where patterns persist across phase shifts.
    This structured substrate is hypothesized to be necessary for rich emergent
    complexity, in contrast to pseudo-random noise which would produce only
    transient, incoherent patterns.

# Design Notes and Implementation Guidance

## Purpose
This Principle Card encodes the Transcendental Substrate Hypothesis as a falsifiable,
experimentally testable hypothesis. It is explicitly marked as:
- **Exploratory**: Not blocking core NRM research
- **Bonus Quest**: Adds depth regardless of outcome
- **Falsifiable**: Clear predictions with success/failure criteria
- **Non-Critical Path**: PC3+ can proceed independently

## Success Criteria
**This principle card succeeds if:**
1. Hypothesis is clearly documented (✓ this template)
2. Experimental design is rigorous (✓ 4 gates with statistical methods)
3. Comparison experiments are executed (⏳ post-Paper 3)
4. Statistical analysis is unbiased (design ensures fairness)
5. Results are published regardless of outcome (commitment to transparency)

**This principle card fails if:**
1. Hypothesis becomes dogma (must remain falsifiable)
2. Comparison is avoided (intellectual cowardice)
3. Only positive results published (publication bias)
4. Blocks core research (violates non-blocking constraint)

## Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Complete):** Establish NRM baseline with transcendental substrate (177+ experiments)
- **Phase 2 (Current):** Design PC2 template (✓ this document)
- **Phase 3 (Future):** Execute PRNG control experiments (post-Paper 3, Cycle 300+)
- **Phase 4 (Future):** Statistical comparison and publication
