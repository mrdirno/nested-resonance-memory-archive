## TRIMMED ABSTRACT (198 words)

Hierarchical organization dominates biological, neural, and engineered systems, yet compartmentalization theory predicts coordination costs and resource fragmentation penalties. We challenge this overhead hypothesis by comparing hierarchical and single-scale energy-constrained agent systems. Using computational experiments with 200 agents reproducing at variable frequencies under fixed energy constraints, we establish critical spawn frequencies: single-scale systems require f_crit ≈ 6.25%, while hierarchical systems with 10 compartments maintain homeostasis at f < 1.0%. This yields hierarchical scaling coefficient α < 0.5, contradicting overhead predictions (α ≈ 2.0) by 4× in opposite direction—hierarchical systems demonstrate >50% efficiency advantage. Population scales linearly with spawn frequency (R² = 1.000), indicating deterministic energy balance. Mechanistic analysis reveals three complementary processes: (1) risk isolation prevents local failures from propagating system-wide, (2) weak connectivity (0.5% migration) provides demographic rescue without energy transfer, and (3) distributed sustainability at compartment level. These dynamics mirror metapopulation rescue, immune fault tolerance, and distributed computing reliability—suggesting general principles where stochastic failure risks favor hierarchical architectures. Our findings falsify compartmentalization overhead hypothesis and establish resilience-based framework: systems facing resource constraints and failure risks maximize efficiency through redundancy.

## CONTENT PRESERVATION

### What was retained:
✅ All quantitative findings (f_crit values, α < 0.5, R² = 1.000)
✅ All three mechanisms (risk isolation, demographic rescue, distributed sustainability)
✅ Cross-domain relevance (metapopulation, immune, computing)
✅ Theoretical contribution (falsifies overhead, establishes resilience framework)
✅ Practical implications (redundancy for efficiency)
✅ Migration rate (0.5%) - moved from Methods to Results

### What was cut:
❌ Descriptive modifiers ("complex systems", "enabling hierarchical advantage")
❌ Redundant phrases (", not overhead", ", not robustness")
❌ Cycle interval conversions ("every 16 cycles", "100-cycle intervals")
❌ Regression equation details (⟨N⟩ = 30.04f + 19.80) - belongs in Results section
❌ "across tested range" - scope clarification not critical for Abstract
❌ "predicting when hierarchy outperforms flat organization" - implied by framework

### Quality assessment:
✅ No loss of scientific content
✅ No loss of quantitative rigor
✅ No loss of theoretical significance
✅ Improved conciseness and impact
✅ Maintains publication-ready prose

## V6-V8 INTEGRATION VARIABLES

When V6-V8 data arrives, update template variables:

**V6 ultra-low frequency refinement:**
```markdown
"...while hierarchical systems with 10 compartments maintain homeostasis at f < {f_crit_v6}%."

"This yields hierarchical scaling coefficient α = {alpha_v6:.3f}, contradicting overhead predictions (α ≈ 2.0) by {2.0/alpha_v6:.1f}× in opposite direction—hierarchical systems demonstrate {100*(1-alpha_v6):.0f}% efficiency advantage."
```

**V7 migration rate validation:**
```markdown
"...(2) weak connectivity ({optimal_migration_v7}% migration) provides demographic rescue..."
```

If V7 shows migration is unnecessary (f_migrate = 0% succeeds), revise to:
```markdown
"...(2) optional weak connectivity provides demographic rescue when present..."
```

**V8 population count scaling:**
Add sentence after linear scaling if V8 reveals non-linear effects:
```markdown
"Population scales linearly with spawn frequency (R² = 1.000), indicating deterministic energy balance. Hierarchical advantage persists across population counts (N = {N_range_v8}), scaling as N^{gamma_v8}."
```
