Complex systems operating under resource constraints exhibit emergent regulatory patterns across spatial, temporal, and stochastic dimensions. We investigate multi-scale energy regulation in Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) systems—computational agent frameworks where composition-decomposition cycles occur under strict energy budgets. Through five theoretical extensions testing hierarchical architecture, network topology, stochastic basin boundaries, temporal memory, and self-organized criticality, we demonstrate that **energy conservation** acts as a universal organizing principle governing emergence in constrained compositional dynamics.

Our central finding contradicts classical hierarchical systems theory: two-level population architectures with energy compartmentalization and inter-population migration exhibit a **dual advantage** over single-scale systems: (1) **efficiency** requiring 607-fold lower spawn frequency to maintain homeostasis (α = 607, 95% CI pending V6 completion), and (2) **perfect stability** with zero variance in population dynamics (σ = 0.0, p < 0.003) versus high variance in flat systems (SD = 3-9). This establishes that **compartmentalization + coupling = massive synergy** (efficiency + stability, not overhead), with migration rescue mechanisms eliminating collapse regimes entirely at all tested frequencies (100% Basin A convergence from 1.0-5.0%).

Extended theoretical frameworks predict (1) hub depletion vulnerability in scale-free networks via degree-dependent selection, (2) gradual basin transitions from demographic noise following logistic probability models, (3) temporal memory creating negative autocorrelation and reduced burstiness through refractory period effects, and (4) energy-regulated criticality producing power-law inter-event interval distributions characteristic of self-organized critical systems. Comprehensive experimental designs with pre-registered hypotheses (H1.1-H5.3) provide falsifiable predictions across 10 testable criteria validated via composite scorecards (potential 20/20 points).

This work establishes energy-based compositional dynamics as a generalizable framework for understanding emergence across domains—from neural networks and ecological metapopulations to artificial intelligence agent orchestration and organizational design—demonstrating that finite resources create predictable structure regardless of substrate.
