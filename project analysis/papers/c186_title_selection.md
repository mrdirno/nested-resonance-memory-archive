**Length:** 104 characters ✅
**Word Count:** 13 words

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Narrative arc (overhead → advantage)

- ✅ Engaging story-like format
- ✅ Broad appeal

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ "Stochastic environments" may be too technical
- ⚠️ Longer (13 words)
- ⚠️ Doesn't specify system type clearly

**Suitability:** 7.5/10 for Nature Communications

## Final Recommendation

### Selected Title:
**"Resilience Through Redundancy: Hierarchical Advantage in Energy-Constrained Agent Systems"**

### Rationale:

1. **Catchy and Memorable:**
   - Alliterative phrase "Resilience Through Redundancy" sticks in mind
   - Simple, powerful principle that transcends disciplines

2. **Broad Appeal:**
   - "Resilience" and "redundancy" are universal concepts
   - Accessible to ecologists, engineers, computer scientists, neuroscientists
   - No jargon or Greek letters

3. **Nature Communications Fit:**
   - Principle-driven (not just technical result)
   - Interdisciplinary appeal
   - Engaging but rigorous
   - Standard format: "[Principle]: [Application in System]"

4. **Optimal Length:**
   - 10 words (sweet spot for titles)
   - 92 characters (well under limits)
   - Easy to cite and remember

5. **Conveys Key Finding:**
   - Hierarchical systems gain advantage through redundancy
   - Redundancy creates resilience (not overhead)
   - Energy constraints are the context

### Alternative (if more technical audience):
**Option 1:** "Hierarchical Organization Reduces Critical Resource Requirements Through Risk Isolation and Demographic Rescue"
- More mechanistically detailed
- Still clear and accessible
- Better for PLOS Computational Biology or Journal of Theoretical Biology
