Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript "Energy-Regulated Population Homeostasis and Timescale-Dependent Constraint Manifestation in Nested Resonance Memory" for consideration as a Research Article in PLOS Computational Biology.

## Summary of Findings

This manuscript reports a novel discovery in computational self-organizing systems: **energy-constrained spawning alone is sufficient for population homeostasis without requiring explicit agent removal mechanisms**. Through systematic multi-scale validation across three temporal windows (100, 1000, and 3000 cycles), we demonstrate that resource constraints are **process-dependent rather than state-dependent**—constraint severity emerges through interaction of population dynamics, compositional load, and observation timescale.

Key contributions include:

1. **Non-Monotonic Timescale Dependency:** Spawn success exhibits a striking pattern (100% → 88.0% ± 2.5% → 23%) across increasing experimental durations, revealing that the same energy configuration manifests as no constraint, partial constraint with recovery, or full constraint depending on temporal window.

2. **Population-Mediated Energy Recovery:** At intermediate timescales (1000 cycles), populations achieve significantly higher density (t(4)=8.63, p=0.0010, d=3.86) than extended-timescale baselines despite intermediate duration—larger populations distribute spawn selection pressure, enabling energy recovery between selections.

3. **Spawns-Per-Agent Threshold Model:** We establish quantitative thresholds (<2.0, 2.0-4.0, >4.0 spawns/agent) predicting population sustainability, providing a mechanistic framework for resource-constrained population dynamics.

4. **Minimal Mechanism Sufficiency:** Failed reproductive attempts from energy depletion create self-regulation without programmed removal logic—high population → high compositional load → low spawn success → growth limitation.

## Significance and Novelty

This work makes both empirical and theoretical contributions:

**Empirical:** The non-monotonic timescale pattern challenges conventional understanding of resource constraints as fixed system properties. Our multi-scale validation protocol reveals dynamics invisible at single timescales, demonstrating methodological value for computational biology studies.

**Theoretical:** We show that traditional population models requiring explicit death-birth balance can be replaced with simpler regulatory mechanisms emerging from reproductive failure. This has implications for understanding natural populations where reproductive failure (not mortality) may be the primary regulatory force.

**Methodological:** We document discovery through failed experiments—a C176 V4/V5 implementation bug initially suggested population collapse but investigation revealed the true mechanism (energy-constrained spawning). This transparency strengthens scientific rigor and provides lessons for computational model validation.

## Why PLOS Computational Biology

PLOS Computational Biology is the ideal venue for this work because:

1. **Computational Modeling Focus:** Our agent-based modeling approach using the Nested Resonance Memory framework aligns with the journal's emphasis on computational methods for biological systems.

2. **Emergent Phenomena:** The journal's audience includes researchers studying self-organization, population dynamics, and emergent complexity—central themes of our work.

3. **Methodological Innovation:** Our multi-scale timescale validation protocol and transparent bug documentation contribute methodological advances valued by PLOS CompBiol readers.

4. **Interdisciplinary Scope:** Our findings bridge computational biology, complex systems, and population ecology—fitting the journal's multidisciplinary mission.

5. **Open Science Alignment:** We provide complete code availability (https://github.com/mrdirno/nested-resonance-memory-archive) and reproducibility documentation, aligning with PLOS's open science values.

We believe this manuscript reports novel findings of significant interest to the computational biology community. The discovery that resource constraints emerge through process dynamics rather than existing as fixed properties has implications for understanding natural and artificial systems alike. The non-monotonic timescale dependency pattern reveals complexity missed by conventional single-timescale analyses.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by any other journal. All authors have approved the manuscript for submission.

Thank you for considering our manuscript for publication in PLOS Computational Biology. We look forward to your response and welcome the opportunity to address any questions from reviewers.
