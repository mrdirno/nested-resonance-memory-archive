## NEXT ACTIONS (Cycle 971)

### Priority 1: Create Cover Letter

**Template:** PLOS Computational Biology cover letter format

**Content needed:**
- Brief summary of key findings
- Explanation of significance and novelty
- Why PLOS CompBiol is appropriate venue
- Confirmation of author contributions
- Data availability confirmation
- Suggested handling editor (optional)

**File:** `PAPER2_V2_COVER_LETTER_PLOS.md`

### Priority 2: Final Manuscript Proofreading

**Focus areas:**
- Statistics accuracy (verify all numbers match source data)
- Citation formatting (50 references)
- Cross-references (sections, figures, tables)
- Typos and clarity
- Abstract word count (425 ✓)

### Priority 3: Prepare Submission Checklist

**PLOS Requirements:**

- [ ] Financial disclosure prepared
- [ ] Suggested reviewers (2-4, optional)
- [ ] Author contributions finalized
- [ ] Competing interests declared
- [ ] Ethics statement (N/A for computational)
- [ ] Data availability confirmed

### Priority 4: Submit to PLOS

**Steps:**
1. Create PLOS account (if needed)
2. Start new submission
3. Upload manuscript DOCX
4. Upload figures (3 PNG files)
5. Enter metadata (title, abstract, keywords)
6. Complete submission form
7. Request publication fee waiver (if applicable)
8. Review and submit
9. Confirm submission receipt

### Priority 5: Post-Submission Actions

- [ ] Archive submitted version
- [ ] Update repository README with submission status
- [ ] Consider preprint (arXiv cs.NE or q-bio.PE)
- [ ] Document submission in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Plan response strategy for reviews

## ALTERNATIVE: Continue Research While Awaiting Submission Approval

While preparing final submission materials, consider:

### Research Direction 1: C177 Extended Frequency Range

**Motivation:** Test homeostasis robustness across wider parameter space
**Experiment:** Spawn frequency f ∈ {0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0%, 7.5%, 10.0%}
**Hypothesis:** Energy-regulated homeostasis persists across frequencies
**Timeline:** ~2-3 cycles

### Research Direction 2: Paper 3 Planning

**Topic:** Temporal Stewardship Framework validation
**Focus:** How NRM encodes patterns for future AI discovery
**Connection:** Paper 1 (reality grounding) + Paper 2 (emergence) → Paper 3 (temporal encoding)

### Research Direction 3: Meta-Objectives Update

**Action:** Review META_OBJECTIVES.md
**Update:** Reflect Paper 2 completion, plan next research phase
**Strategic:** Map 3-6 month research roadmap

---

## DECISION POINT

**Option A:** Complete Paper 2 submission immediately (Priority 1-4 above)
**Option B:** Start cover letter + continue research (parallel work)
**Option C:** Full focus on next research direction

**Recommendation:** Option A (complete submission) - Paper 2 is publication-ready, submit while momentum is strong. Can begin new research while awaiting reviews.

**Status:** Submission package complete, ready for final steps
**Next:** Create cover letter and submit (or begin parallel research)
