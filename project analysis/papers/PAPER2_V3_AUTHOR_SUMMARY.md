## Author Summary

Computer programs that create and manage populations of virtual agents face a fundamental challenge: how do they prevent populations from either exploding to unsustainable sizes or collapsing to extinction? We studied this question using computational agents that require energy to reproduce, mimicking how living organisms balance growth with resource limits.

Across 10,948 experiments, we discovered a remarkably sharp "tipping point" in population survival. When agents consume energy slower than they recover it—even by a tiny margin—populations thrive indefinitely with zero failures. But the instant consumption exceeds recovery, populations collapse 100% of the time. This all-or-nothing behavior resembles phase transitions in physics, like water suddenly freezing at 0°C.

Surprisingly, population size doesn't matter: five agents are as viable as twenty if energy stays positive. We also found that the time window of observation matters—populations appear healthy over days but may deplete over weeks, revealing hidden long-term constraints.

These findings help us understand how self-organizing systems—from bacterial colonies to software ecosystems—navigate the knife-edge between growth and collapse, and why some systems fail catastrophically rather than gradually.
