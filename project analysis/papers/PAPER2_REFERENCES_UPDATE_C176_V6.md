## LITERATURE SEARCH PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Check Internal Project Status

**Questions:**
1. Have Papers 1, 5D, 6, 6B, 7, 9 been submitted to arXiv?
2. If yes, obtain preprint IDs for citation
3. If no, decide whether to reference as "in preparation" or include in Supplementary Materials

**Priority:** Self-Giving Systems and Temporal Stewardship frameworks (central to Discussion)

### Step 2: Targeted Literature Search

**Databases to Search:**
- Google Scholar
- PubMed (for ecology/biology papers)
- arXiv (for complex systems/physics papers)
- Web of Science (if available)

**Keywords by Category:**

**Multi-Scale Validation:**
- "multi-scale temporal analysis"
- "timescale-dependent dynamics"
- "temporal regime transitions"
- "scale-dependent mechanisms"

**Energy Pooling:**
- "distributed resource recovery"
- "collective resource management"
- "load balancing ecology"
- "resource patch dynamics"

**Non-Monotonic Patterns:**
- "non-monotonic response curves"
- "intermediate optimum"
- "U-shaped dynamics"
- "intermediate disturbance hypothesis"

**Search Constraints:**
- Years: 1990-2025 (prefer recent, but classic papers acceptable)
- Peer-reviewed journal articles or well-cited preprints
- Relevance: Conceptual parallels to population-mediated energy recovery sufficient (exact match not required)

### Step 3: Citation Selection Criteria

**Include if:**
1. Provides theoretical foundation for multi-scale validation approach
2. Documents analogous non-monotonic patterns in other systems
3. Describes distributed load balancing or resource recovery mechanisms
4. Widely cited (>100 citations preferred) or recent high-impact work
5. Accessible (open access or institutional access available)

**Exclude if:**
1. Only tangentially related
2. Outdated methodology (superseded by better work)
3. Low quality (non-peer-reviewed blog posts, etc.)
4. Contradicts our findings without adding value to discussion

**Target:** 3-5 new citations total (keep References section manageable)
