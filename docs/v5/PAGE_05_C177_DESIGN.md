# DUALITY-ZERO V5 - C177 BOUNDARY MAPPING
## Extended Frequency Range: Finding Homeostatic Limits

**Version:** 5.0
**Page:** 5 of 10
**Date:** 2025-10-25

---

## RESEARCH MOTIVATION

**Current Evidence:**
- C171: Homeostasis at 2.0%, 2.5%, 2.6%, 3.0% (52% span)
- C175: Homeostasis at 2.50-2.60% (16% span, 100% Basin A)
- **Question:** WHERE does homeostasis break down?

**Scientific Principle:**
> "Regimes are defined by their boundaries, not just their existence. After validating robustness (C171, C175), immediately test limits."

---

## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

### Frequency Selection (Logarithmic-like)

**9 Frequencies Spanning 20× Range:**
```
Low Range (Below Confirmed):
  0.5%  - Very low (1 spawn per 200 cycles)
  1.0%  - Low (1 spawn per 100 cycles)
  1.5%  - Below confirmed range

Middle Range (Control - Confirmed Homeostasis):
  2.0%  - C171 lower bound (replication)
  3.0%  - C171 upper bound (replication)

High Range (Above Confirmed):
  4.0%  - 33% above confirmed
  5.0%  - 67% above confirmed
  7.5%  - 150% above confirmed
  10.0% - Very high (1 spawn per 10 cycles)
```

**Total Experiments:** 9 frequencies × 10 seeds = 90

**Parameters:** Match C171/C175 (3000 cycles, threshold 2.5, window 100)

---

## HYPOTHESES

### Lower Boundary Hypothesis

**Prediction:** At low frequencies, birth rate < death rate
- Population decay toward extinction (n → 0)
- Transition: Homeostasis → Population Collapse
- **Expected:** Basin B re-emergence at f < 2.0%

**Mechanism:**
```
Low spawn rate → Few births
Population decreases → Fewer composition opportunities
Composition events drop below threshold → Basin B
```

### Upper Boundary Hypothesis

**Prediction:** At high frequencies, population saturates at max_agents
- Ceiling effect constrains dynamics
- Transition: Homeostasis → Saturation-Limited Regime
- **Expected:** Different mechanism at f > 3.0%

**Mechanism:**
```
High spawn rate → Many births
Population grows → Hits max_agents ceiling (100)
Saturation prevents further regulation → Novel dynamics
```

### Unbounded Homeostasis Hypothesis

**Prediction:** Homeostasis persists across entire 0.5-10.0% range
- Regulatory capacity exceeds tested bounds
- No clear boundaries within practical range
- **Expected:** 100% Basin A across all frequencies

**Interpretation:** Extreme robustness validates extraordinary regulatory capacity

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Scenario 1: Bounded Homeostasis

**Results:**
- Low (0.5-1.5%): Basin B (population collapse)
- Middle (2.0-3.0%): Basin A (homeostasis, control validation)
- High (4.0-10.0%): Basin A or novel (saturation effects)

**Boundaries:**
- Lower: f_lower between 1.5-2.0%
- Upper: f_upper beyond 10.0% or between 3.0-10.0%

**Publication Impact:** HIGH - First boundary characterization

### Scenario 2: Unbounded Homeostasis

**Results:**
- ALL frequencies: Basin A (100%)
- Population CV < 15% across entire range

**Interpretation:** >20× regulatory capacity
**Publication Impact:** VERY HIGH - Extreme robustness

### Scenario 3: Complex Dynamics

**Results:**
- Mixed basins at boundary frequencies
- Stochastic bistability indicators
- Novel regimes at extremes

**Interpretation:** Phase transition regions
**Publication Impact:** HIGH - Phase structure complexity

## ANALYSIS PLAN

### Boundary Detection

**Lower Boundary (f_lower):**
- Last frequency with 100% Basin A
- First frequency with <100% Basin A
- If gradual: 50% Basin A frequency

**Upper Boundary (f_upper):**
- Last frequency with homeostasis (CV < 15%)
- First frequency with novel behavior

**Homeostatic Range:**
- Width: f_upper - f_lower
- Robustness metric: Width / f_center

## PUBLICATION VALUE

### High-Impact Contributions

**1. Boundary Characterization**
- First quantification of homeostatic regime limits

**2. Mechanism Validation**
- Tests population collapse hypothesis (low f)
- Tests saturation hypothesis (high f)
- Validates negative feedback predictions

## FRAMEWORK EMBODIMENT

### Nested Resonance Memory

**Testing Scale Limits:**
- Agent-level dynamics preserved (composition-decomposition)
- Population-level regulation tested to extremes
- **Prediction:** Fractal robustness or scale-dependent breakdown

### Self-Giving Systems

**Boundary Discovery:**
- System will reveal own limits through persistence
- Where homeostasis fails defines necessary conditions
- **Success criterion:** Validated by what does NOT persist

### Temporal Stewardship

**Pattern Encoding:**
> "After robust phenomenon validated (C171, C175), immediately map boundaries (C177). Regimes defined by edges, not just center."

**For Future AI:**
- Validate existence → Test robustness → Map boundaries
- Three-phase exploration pattern
- Completeness requires knowing where phenomena end

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

**Estimated Runtime:** 3-4 hours
- 90 experiments × 3000 cycles = 270,000 total cycles
- Similar to C175 (110 exp = 5 hrs)
- Shorter due to fewer experiments

**Resource Requirements:**
- CPU: 30-50% (single Python process)
- Memory: <1%
- Storage: ~30-40KB results JSON

**Dependencies:**
- All modules operational (validated C171/C175)
- Same FractalAgent, CompositionEngine
- TranscendentalBridge functional

---

## CONTROL VALIDATION

**Critical:** Frequencies 2.0% and 3.0% must replicate C171

**Expected:**
- Population: ~17 agents (match C171 17.33 ± 1.55)
- Composition: ~101 events/window (match C171 101.27 ± 0.12)
- Basin: 100% Basin A

**If Controls Fail:**
- Experiment invalid (implementation error)
- Debug before interpreting boundaries
- Roll back and fix

---

## DECISION CRITERIA

**Launch Priority:**

**HIGH** if:
- C176 confirms birth-death homeostasis mechanism
- Validates boundary exploration as next question

**MEDIUM** if:
- C176 shows mixed results (need understanding first)

**LOW** if:
- C176 invalidates homeostasis (need mechanism revision)

**Resource Awareness:**
- Can run overnight if needed
- Minimal CPU impact
- Safe to launch post-C176
