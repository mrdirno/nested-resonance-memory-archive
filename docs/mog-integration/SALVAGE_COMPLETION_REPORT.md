# MOG SALVAGE COMPLETION REPORT: SCAVENGER PROTOCOL

**DATE:** 2025-11-19
**OPERATOR:** Gemini 3 Pro (The Archeologist)
**STATUS:** MISSION COMPLETE

---

## 1. MISSION SUMMARY
The "Deep Salvage" operation has concluded. Following the discovery of broken legacy code, the **Scavenger Protocol** was executed to selectively ingest high-value assets without compromising the NRM codebase.

**TOTAL ASSETS SALVAGED:**
*   **Theory:** 1 Critical Document (The "Rosetta Stone")
*   **Patterns:** ~50 Validation Scripts (Reference Only)
*   **UI:** ~20 React Components (Reference Only)

---

## 2. ASSET INVENTORY

### A. THE BRAIN (Theory)
*   **Source:** `duality/USER-PROTECTED/The Duality Protocol - with math and rigor.md`
*   **Destination:** `docs/theory/legacy/The Duality Protocol - with math and rigor.md`
*   **Value:** Contains the missing mathematical definition of **HeliosEvolver** (Evolutionary Code Mutation). This is the blueprint for the next phase of NRM.

### B. THE ENGINE (Patterns)
*   **Source:** `Resonance-is-All-You-Need/test/*`
*   **Destination:** `legacy_intake/reference_patterns/`
*   **Key Files:**
    *   `quantum-acoustic-resonance-validation.js`
    *   `test_3d_cosmic_cymatics_visualizer.py`
    *   `gravitational-wave-validation-suite.js`
*   **Usage Directive:** **DO NOT EXECUTE.** Use these files as *logic templates* to write new Python tests for the NRM Swarm.

### C. THE FACE (UI)
*   **Source:** `v0-1shotalpha-com/components/*`
*   **Destination:** `legacy_intake/reference_ui/`
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `solar-system-3d.tsx` (Likely)
    *   `dashboard-layout.tsx`
*   **Usage Directive:** **DO NOT IMPORT DIRECTLY.** Inspect code for design patterns and port to NRM's dashboard manually.

## 3. NEXT STEPS (MOG DIRECTIVE)

1.  **Study the Theory:** Analyze `The Duality Protocol` to spec out `HeliosEvolver`.
2.  **Port the Patterns:** Create a new `tests/resonance/` directory and begin translating the JS logic to Python.
3.  **Design the Dashboard:** Use the salvaged UI components to design the `nrm-dashboard`.

**MISSION STATUS: SUCCESS.**
The "Lost Tech" has been recovered. The "Ghost Code" has been avoided.
