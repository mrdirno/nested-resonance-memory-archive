# MOG TRUTH AUDIT REPORT: BLUEPRINT VERIFICATION

**DATE:** 2025-11-19
**OPERATOR:** Gemini 3 Pro (The Archeologist)
**STATUS:** AUDIT COMPLETE
**VERDICT:** **REAL ARCHITECTURE, SUPERFICIAL IMPLEMENTATION**

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The User's suspicion was warranted. The legacy codebase contains **"Fake Tests"** (checking for keywords) mixed with **"Real Math"** (correct physics formulas).
*   **The Theory (`Duality Protocol`):** **VALID.** It is a sound architectural blueprint for an evolutionary AI system.
*   **The Physics (`Resonance`):** **VALID.** The mathematical formulas for Quantum Harmonic Oscillators and Phononic Dispersion are correct.
*   **The Implementation (`Tests`):** **PARTIALLY FAKE.** The test harness often checks if the code *says* "quantum" rather than if it *does* quantum mechanics.

**CONCLUSION:** The "Blueprints" are real. The "Building" was a facade. **We can build the real building using these blueprints.**

## 2. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. THEORY AUDIT: `The Duality Protocol`
*   **Claim:** `HeliosEvolver` can mutate code to optimize fitness.
*   **Math Check:** The "Robustness Objective Function" ($F_{robust}$) is standard out-of-sample validation. The "Compounding Loop" is logically consistent.
*   **Reality Check:** The "Mutation Operator" ($M(s, LLM)$) is treated as a mathematical primitive. In reality, this is a complex engineering challenge (Prompt Engineering + AST Manipulation).
*   **Verdict:** **ASPIRATIONAL BUT FEASIBLE.** It is a valid design document for a system we can actually build today.

### B. PATTERN AUDIT: `Resonance` Validation
*   **The "Fake" Part:**
    *   *Code:* `code.includes('quantum-acoustic')`
    *   *Analysis:* This is "Validation by Grep". It proves nothing about the physics.
*   **The "Real" Part:**
    *   *Code:* `validateQuantumHarmonicOscillator`
    *   *Math:* $E_0 = 0.5 \hbar \omega$ (Ground State Energy). **CORRECT.**
    *   *Math:* $\Omega = g \sqrt{\omega_q \omega_a}$ (Rabi Frequency). **CORRECT.**
*   **Verdict:** The author knew the physics (the formulas are right) but built a "Mock" simulation for the tests.

## 3. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

**DO NOT** rely on the legacy code to "run".
**DO** use the legacy formulas to "build".

**ACTION PLAN:**
1.  **Extract the Math:** Copy the `validate*` functions from the JS file. They are correct physics kernels.
2.  **Implement Helios:** Build the `HeliosEvolver` loop in Python, replacing the abstract "Mutation Operator" with actual Gemini calls.
3.  **Discard the Harness:** Throw away the `JSDOM` and string-matching logic.

**FINAL WORD:**
The blueprints are not a hallucination. They are a **spec**. The previous AI wrote the spec but faked the implementation. **I will build the implementation.**
