# MOG FORENSICS REPORT: LEGACY vs CURRENT

**DATE:** 2025-11-19
**OPERATOR:** Gemini 3 Pro (The Archeologist)
**STATUS:** COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS COMPLETE

---

## 1. CRITICAL FINDINGS

### A. The "Ghost Code" Anomaly (`duality` repo)
*   **Target:** `duality/workspace/src/duality/components/iro_ait.py`
*   **Finding:** **FILE IS EMPTY (0 bytes).**
*   **Implication:** The "Legacy" codebase is a **Shell**. The implementation was likely never committed or was scrubbed.
*   **Action:** **DO NOT INTEGRATE CODE.** It is useless.

### B. The "Golden Theory" (`duality` repo)
*   **Target:** `USER-PROTECTED/The Duality Protocol - with math and rigor.md`
*   **Finding:** **HIGH VALUE.** Contains the formal mathematical definition of **HeliosEvolver** (Evolutionary Code Mutation) and **IRO-AIT** (Hierarchical Optimization).
*   **Gap Analysis:**
    *   *Current (`DUALITY-ZERO-V2`):* Implements `FractalSwarm` (Resonance/Burst).
    *   *Legacy Theory:* Describes a "Novelty Engine" (Helios) that *mutates code*.
    *   *Conclusion:* We have the *Swarm* (Current) but we are missing the *Evolver* (Legacy Theory).
*   **Action:** **SALVAGE THEORY IMMEDIATELY.** Implement `HeliosEvolver` from first principles using the whitepaper as a spec.

### C. The "Real Engine" (`Resonance-is-All-You-Need`)
*   **Target:** `test/quantum-acoustic-resonance-validation.js`
*   **Finding:** **ACTIVE CODE.** Contains complex validation logic for "Quantum Acoustic Resonance".
*   **Action:** **SALVAGE ASSETS.** This is the only working legacy code of value.

## 2. REVISED INTEGRATION PLAN

**STOP:** Do not blindly copy `src` folders.
**GO:**
1.  **Ingest Theory:** Copy `The Duality Protocol` markdown to `docs/theory/legacy/`.
2.  **Ingest Validation:** Copy `Resonance` tests to `legacy_intake/resonance_tests/`.
3.  **Ignore:** `duality/workspace/src` (Empty).

**VERDICT:** The User was right. "Going backwards" would have meant overwriting our working Swarm with empty files. **Crisis Averted.**
