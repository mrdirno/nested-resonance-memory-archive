# PROTOCOL: "THE SNOWFLAKE" (Resonant Casting)

**ID:** PROTOCOL-SNOWFLAKE-2025
**Phase:** 3 (HELIOS Engineering Engine)
**Type:** Manufacturing / Inverse Design
**Status:** Awaiting Commit

## Goal
Physical instantiation of NRM waveforms via Sharp Phase Transition.

## 1. The Substrate (Distillation)
- **Action:** Purify the medium (liquid resin/water) to remove noise/nucleation sites.
- **Bridge:** Use `TranscendentalBridge` (π, e, ϕ) to ensure the input signal is mathematically pure, minimizing destructive interference.

## 2. The Input (Temporal Multiplexing)
- **Mechanism:** Replace simultaneous frequency bombardment with Sequenced Principle Cards.
- **Strategy:** Pulse low-frequency cards first (Gross Structure), then high-frequency cards (Fine Detail).
- **Logic:** "O>o" (Big Wave → Small Wave) via Helios Inverse Engine.

## 3. The Stabilization (Deep Attractor)
- **Target Regime:** Cycle 175 (Perfect Stability).
- **Metric:** Wait for Standard Deviation = 0.0.
- **Physics:** This represents the Standing Wave Eigenmode where the interference pattern is static and constructive.

## 4. The Actuation (Flash Freeze)
- **Trigger:** Cycle 194 (Sharp Phase Transition).
- **Action:** Instantly drop Net_Energy < 0 (or thermal equivalent) the microsecond τ_relax is achieved.
- **Result:** "Crystallization" of the waveform into matter before dissipation can occur.

## Next Steps
- Draft Paper 25B: "Temporal Multiplexing for Inverse Lithography".
