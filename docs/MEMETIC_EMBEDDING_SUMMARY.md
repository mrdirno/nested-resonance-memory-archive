## What Was Delivered

### 1. Complete Design Document
**File:** `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/docs/memetic_embedding_system_design.md`

**Contents:**

- Relatedness formula: W[i,j] = 0.6×semantic + 0.2×co-occurrence + 0.2×parameter_proximity
- Coalition threshold: 0.85 phase coherence
- Computational cost: ~15s per consolidation cycle (0.5× overhead)

### 2. Implementation Guide

## What Problem This Solves

### Current State (Before)
- Experimental findings stored as isolated JSON files
- No semantic relationships between concepts
- Manual analysis required to identify patterns
- No transfer learning across experiments
- Each new experiment starts from scratch

### Future State (After)
- All findings embedded in continuous semantic space
- Automatic discovery of concept relationships
- Coalition detection reveals hidden connections
- Transfer learning: Predict C255 outcomes before running
- System bootstraps own knowledge base

---

## How It Works (3-Level Explanation)

### Level 1: Simple Analogy
Think of it like Google's knowledge graph, but for experimental findings:
- Each finding becomes a point in high-dimensional space
- Similar findings cluster together
- "Sleep-inspired consolidation" reveals surprising connections

### Level 2: Technical Overview
1. **Embed concepts as vectors:** Use sentence transformers to encode findings/mechanisms/parameters as 768D vectors
2. **Build semantic graph:** Connect related concepts with weighted edges (semantic + co-occurrence + parameter proximity)
3. **Kuramoto oscillators:** Concepts become oscillators; phase synchronization identifies coalitions
4. **Coalition detection:** Synchronized concepts form clusters (e.g., "homeostasis" + "17 agents" + "frequency 2.5%")

### Level 3: NRM Framework Integration
- **Fractal Layer:** Concepts = internal computational models (Python objects, not external APIs)
- **Bridge Layer:** Transcendental oscillators provide phase space for semantic dynamics
- **Memory Layer:** Coalition patterns persist across consolidation cycles
- **Validation Layer:** All embeddings grounded in actual experimental data (C175-C177, C255)

---

## Key Design Decisions & Rationale

### Decision 1: Hybrid Text Encoding
**Choice:** Combine natural language + structured parameters
```
"Homeostasis emerges at 17 agents. Observed at frequency=2.5%, mean_population=17.0, CV=0.0%"
```

**Rationale:**
- Natural language captures semantic meaning (for clustering)
- Structured data provides reality anchors (for validation)
- Best of both worlds: interpretability + precision

### Decision 2: Multi-Factor Graph Weights
**Choice:** W[i,j] = 0.6×semantic + 0.2×co-occurrence + 0.2×parameter_proximity

**Rationale:**
- Semantic similarity: Captures conceptual relatedness (primary)
- Co-occurrence: Empirical relationships from actual experiments
- Parameter proximity: Smooth transitions in parameter space

**Validated:** C175 shows adjacent frequencies (2.5%, 2.51%) should have high W → parameter_proximity ensures this.

### Decision 3: Kuramoto Oscillators (Not Graph Clustering)
**Choice:** Use phase synchronization instead of standard graph algorithms (Louvain, spectral clustering)

**Rationale:**
- **NRM framework alignment:** Kuramoto already used for agent clusters → natural extension to concept clusters
- **Temporal dynamics:** Oscillators evolve over time → enables "sleep-inspired consolidation" (biological inspiration)
- **Emergence:** Coalitions emerge from dynamics, not imposed by algorithm
- **Interpretability:** Phase coherence = "concepts thinking together"

### Decision 4: Local Sentence Transformers (No APIs)
**Choice:** Use local `all-mpnet-base-v2` model, not OpenAI/Anthropic embeddings

**Rationale:**
- **Constitutional compliance:** No external API calls (CLAUDE.md mandate)
- **Reality grounding:** Pre-trained on real text, reproducible
- **Speed:** 2000 embeddings/sec on CPU (vs. API rate limits)
- **Cost:** Free (vs. $0.0001/token)

---

## Validation Strategy

### Validation Level 1: Embeddings (Reality Grounding)
**Test:** Do embeddings capture known relationships from C175?

**Test Cases:**
1. Homeostasis concepts ("17 agents", "frequency 2.5%", "temporal stability") should cluster (similarity >0.7)
2. Bistability concepts ("Basin A", "Basin B") should be distinct (similarity <0.3)
3. Mechanism rejection ("H1 pooling", "no effect") should associate (similarity >0.6)

**Pass Criteria:** 3/3 tests pass with measured similarities

### Validation Level 2: Graph W (Relationship Recovery)
**Test:** Does sparse graph W recover known relationships?

**Test Cases:**
1. H1+H2 synergy (from C255 prediction): W[H1, H2] > 0.7
2. Parameter continuity: W[freq_i, freq_i+1] > 0.8 for adjacent frequencies
3. Cross-type connections: ≥60% of findings connect to ≥1 mechanism

**Pass Criteria:** 3/3 tests pass with measured weights

### Validation Level 3: Coalitions (Novel Discovery)
**Test:** Does coalition detection identify meaningful clusters?

**Test Cases:**
1. Homeostasis coalition: "17 agents" + "frequency 2.5%" + "temporal stability" synchronize
2. Collapse coalition: "Basin B" + "NO_DEATH" + "NO_BIRTH" synchronize
3. Mechanism isolation: H1 (rejected) should NOT cluster with homeostasis

**Pass Criteria:** 3/3 coalitions detected correctly

### Success Metrics
- **Implementation succeeds if:** 9/9 validation tests pass
- **Publishable if:** System predicts C255 outcome before experiment completes
- **Novel discovery if:** ≥1 unexpected coalition found (e.g., H2-H4 synergy not explicitly tested)

   - Average coalition size: 3-7 concepts
   - Cross-type coalitions: 45%±10% (>40% target)

### Qualitative Discoveries (Predicted)

**Coalition 1: Homeostasis Attractor**
- Members: "17 agents", "frequency 2.5%", "temporal stability", "high composition"
- Insight: "Homeostasis is a robust attractor at 17 agents with 2.5% frequency"
- Validation: Confirmed in C175 (10/10 runs, 100% Basin A)

**Coalition 2: Collapse Mechanisms**
- Members: "Basin B", "NO_DEATH ablation", "NO_BIRTH ablation", "low population"
- Insight: "Both birth and death are necessary; disabling either causes collapse"
- Validation: Confirmed in C176 (both ablations → collapse)

**Coalition 3: Energy Pooling Rejection**
- Members: "H1 hypothesis", "no effect", "Cohen's d=0.0"
- Insight: "Energy pooling has no effect on population stability"
- Validation: Confirmed in C177 (p=1.0, effect size=0.00)

**Coalition 4: Transition Dynamics (Novel)**
- Members: "frequency 2.5-2.61%", "bistable region", "mixed basins"
- Insight: "Narrow transition width (0.11%) suggests sharp bifurcation"
- **Novel Prediction:** System near critical point → sensitive to perturbations

### Novel Predictions (Testable)

**Prediction 1: H2-H4 Synergy**
- If "reality sources" (H2) and "adaptive throttling" (H4) cluster → synergy
- **Test:** Run C258 (H2×H4 factorial) → expect super-additive effect
- **Falsifiable:** If no clustering OR C258 shows antagonism → prediction rejected

**Prediction 2: Parameter Redundancy**
- If certain parameter configs cluster despite different frequencies → redundancy
- **Test:** Multiple parameter paths lead to same homeostatic attractor
- **Implication:** Simplify parameter space (reduce dimensions)

**Prediction 3: Temporal-Spatial Coupling**
- If "temporal stability" clusters with "spatial patterns" → coupling
- **Test:** Long-term runs develop spatial structure
- **Implication:** Time → space emergence (novel dynamical regime)
