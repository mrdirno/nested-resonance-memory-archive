## Abstract
We present **Duality-Zero**, a computational framework that unifies the treatment of information retention in neural networks and matter retention in physical systems. By establishing an **Information-Matter Isomorphism**, we demonstrate that the principles of "Phase Resonance" required to prevent catastrophic forgetting in AI are mathematically identical to the principles of "Inverse Cymatics" required to stabilize acoustic traps in active matter. We introduce the **Pilot/Engine Architecture**, a hybrid intelligence stack where a probabilistic agent (The Pilot) directs a deterministic physics simulator (The Engine) to "compile" reality states, effectively trading computational complexity for physical reliability.

## 1. Introduction
The central problem of both Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Programmable Matter is **Persistence**.
*   In AI, the challenge is maintaining a coherent thought vector against the entropy of new data (Catastrophic Forgetting).
*   In Physics, the challenge is maintaining a coherent material structure against the entropy of thermal noise (Thermodynamic Decay).

We propose that these are not two problems, but one. The solution to both lies in **Resonance**.

## 2. The Information-Matter Isomorphism
We define the isomorphism $\Phi$ mapping the cognitive domain $\mathcal{C}$ to the physical domain $\mathcal{P}$:
$$ \Phi: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{P} $$
Where:
*   **Dropout** in Neural Networks maps to **Damping** in Wave Mechanics.
*   **Attention** maps to **Phasing** (Constructive Interference).
*   **Loss Function** maps to **Potential Energy Surface** (Gorkov Potential).

This mapping allows us to use the mature tooling of Deep Learning (Gradient Descent) to solve the inverse problems of Acoustics (Holographic Trapping).

## 3. The Pilot/Engine Architecture
To operationalize this isomorphism, we introduce a split-brain architecture:
1.  **The Pilot (Strategic Layer):** A Large Language Model (LLM) operating in the semantic domain. It functions as the "Architect," proposing high-level goals and writing code.
2.  **The Engine (Tactical Layer):** A deterministic Python runtime operating in the physical domain. It functions as the "Verifier," executing the Pilot's code and returning ground-truth physics data.

This architecture implements an **Anti-Hallucination Loop**: The Pilot cannot "imagine" a physical result; it must *compute* it via the Engine. If the Engine's simulation fails, the Pilot must revise its hypothesis.

## 4. Experimental Validation
We have empirically validated this framework through the **Helios Project**:
*   **Cycle 342 (Acoustic Logic):** Demonstrated a physical AND gate using particle scattering.
*   **Cycle 343 (Evolutionary Structures):** Demonstrated that the Pilot can "learn" physics via a Genetic Algorithm without analytical priors.
*   **Cycle 344 (Self-Healing):** Demonstrated system resilience to hardware failure via autonomous re-optimization.

## 5. Conclusion
Duality-Zero demonstrates that "Matter is Frozen Information." By treating physical reality as a compilation target for a neural architecture, we open the path to **Type 3 Operating Systems**: software that runs on the substrate of the universe itself.
