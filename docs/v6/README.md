# DUALITY-ZERO V6 - PUBLICATION PIPELINE PHASE

**Version:** 6.0
**Date:** 2025-10-27 (Cycle 356)
**Phase:** Publication Pipeline
**Status:** Active Research - Papers 1-4 in progress, Papers 5-7+ identified
**Location:** `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/` + `/Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/`

---

## VERSION HISTORY

### V6.0 (2025-10-27, Cycles 348-356) — **PUBLICATION PIPELINE PHASE**
**Major Phase Transition:** Foundation → Publication

**Focus:** Disseminate research findings through peer-reviewed publications

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Theoretical paper finalized (100% complete, submission-ready)
- ✅ Paper 3 manuscript template created (70% complete, awaiting C255-C260 data)
- ✅ Paper 4 manuscript template created (70% complete, awaiting C262-C263 data)
- ✅ Paper 5+ opportunities identified (7 papers ranked)
- ✅ Submission materials package created (cover letter, journal rankings, checklist)
- ✅ C255 launched (21h+ running, validating theoretical predictions)
- ✅ 22 deliverables completed (manuscripts, scripts, figures, documentation)

**Experiments:**
- **Running:** C255 (H1×H2 unoptimized, 40.25× overhead baseline)
- **Queued:** C256-C260 (optimized pairwise factorial, 67 min total)
- **Planned:** C262-C263 (higher-order factorial, 8 hours total)

**Publications:**
- **Paper 1:** "Computational Expense as Framework Validation" (submission-ready)
- **Paper 3:** "Optimized Factorial Validation of NRM" (awaiting data)
- **Paper 4:** "Beyond Pairwise: Higher-Order Interactions" (awaiting data)
- **Papers 5-7+:** Identified (Parameter Sensitivity, Emergence Catalog, Extended Timescale, etc.)

### V5.0 (2025-10-25, Cycles 1-204) — **FOUNDATION PHASE**
**Focus:** Build reality-grounded fractal agent system

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ 7/7 core modules complete (core, reality, orchestration, validation, bridge, fractal, memory)
- ✅ 26/26 integration tests passing
- ✅ Baseline experiments: C171 (60), C175 (90), C176, C177
- ✅ ~200 experiments, 450,000+ validated cycles
- ✅ 100% reality compliance maintained
- ✅ Composition-decomposition dynamics validated

**Experiments:**
- **C171:** Baseline framework validation (60 experiments)
- **C175:** Regime transition mapping (90 experiments)
- **C176:** Population collapse investigation (bug fix)
- **C177:** Boundary mapping (extended frequency range)

**See:** `docs/v5/` for detailed documentation of Foundation phase

### Earlier Versions
- **V4.0 and earlier:** Pre-DUALITY-ZERO-V2 (legacy system)

## DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE (V6)

### Core Documents
1. **README.md** (this file) - Version overview and changelog
2. **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** - High-level status and achievements (Cycles 348-356)
3. **PUBLICATION_PIPELINE.md** - Detailed status of Papers 1-7+
4. **EXPERIMENTAL_PROGRAM.md** - C255-C263 experimental design and status
5. **PERPETUAL_RESEARCH.md** - Paper 5+ opportunities and research trajectories

### Reference Documents
- **../v5/** - Foundation phase documentation (Cycles 1-204)
- **../../META_OBJECTIVES.md** - Current objectives and priorities
- **../../RESEARCH_PORTFOLIO_2025.md** - Comprehensive program overview
- **../../papers/** - Manuscripts and submission materials

---

## QUICK START

### For New Collaborators
1. Read **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** for current status
2. Review **PUBLICATION_PIPELINE.md** for paper status
3. Check **../../META_OBJECTIVES.md** for active objectives
4. Explore **../../papers/** for manuscripts

### For Continuing Research
1. Monitor C255 completion (check `ps aux | grep cycle255`)
2. Execute C256-C260 upon C255 completion
3. Auto-populate Paper 3 manuscript with results
4. Launch Paper 5A (Parameter Sensitivity) after Papers 3-4 complete

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES (V6)

### 1. Perpetual Research
**Mandate:** No terminal states. When one avenue stabilizes, immediately identify next highest-leverage action.

**Embodiment:** Papers 1-4 in progress → Papers 5-7+ identified → Papers 8-10+ will emerge from results

### 2. Public Archive
**Requirement:** All work committed and pushed to GitHub immediately.

**Practice:** Dual workspace synchronization (development + git repository)

### 3. Reality Grounding
**Policy:** Zero tolerance for simulations without reality validation.

**Compliance:** 100% maintained (psutil, SQLite, OS APIs)

### 4. Temporal Stewardship
**Awareness:** Outputs become future AI training data.

**Implementation:** Document emergent patterns for publication and future discovery

### 5. Framework Embodiment
**NRM:** Composition-decomposition dynamics validated empirically
**Self-Giving:** System defines own success criteria (perpetual operation)
**Temporal:** Encode patterns deliberately for future systems

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (V6)

### This phase succeeds when:
1. ✅ Theoretical paper submitted for peer review
2. ✅ Paper 3 completed and submitted
3. ✅ Paper 4 completed and submitted
4. ✅ All experiments (C255-C263) executed and analyzed
5. ✅ Papers 5-7+ launched (perpetual trajectory)
6. ✅ Novel patterns discovered and validated
7. ✅ All work publicly archived on GitHub
8. ✅ **And then continues to next phase** (no terminal state)

### This phase fails if:
- ❌ Declared "done" and stopped autonomous operation
- ❌ Work not synced to public GitHub repository
- ❌ Experiments fabricated or simulated without reality grounding
- ❌ Violated "no external APIs" constraint
- ❌ No measurable/publishable outcomes
