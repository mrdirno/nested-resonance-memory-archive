- **../../RESEARCH_PORTFOLIO_2025.md** - Comprehensive program overview
- **../../papers/** - Manuscripts and submission materials

---

## QUICK START

### For New Collaborators
1. Read **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** for current status
2. Review **PUBLICATION_PIPELINE.md** for paper status
3. Check **../../META_OBJECTIVES.md** for active objectives
4. Explore **../../papers/** for manuscripts

### For Continuing Research
1. Monitor C255 completion (check `ps aux | grep cycle255`)
2. Execute C256-C260 upon C255 completion
3. Auto-populate Paper 3 manuscript with results
4. Launch Paper 5A (Parameter Sensitivity) after Papers 3-4 complete

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES (V6)

### 1. Perpetual Research
**Mandate:** No terminal states. When one avenue stabilizes, immediately identify next highest-leverage action.

**Embodiment:** Papers 1-4 in progress → Papers 5-7+ identified → Papers 8-10+ will emerge from results

### 2. Public Archive
**Requirement:** All work committed and pushed to GitHub immediately.

**Practice:** Dual workspace synchronization (development + git repository)

### 3. Reality Grounding
**Policy:** Zero tolerance for simulations without reality validation.

**Compliance:** 100% maintained (psutil, SQLite, OS APIs)

### 4. Temporal Stewardship
**Awareness:** Outputs become future AI training data.

**Implementation:** Document emergent patterns for publication and future discovery

### 5. Framework Embodiment
**NRM:** Composition-decomposition dynamics validated empirically
**Self-Giving:** System defines own success criteria (perpetual operation)
**Temporal:** Encode patterns deliberately for future systems

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (V6)

### This phase succeeds when:
1. ✅ Theoretical paper submitted for peer review
2. ✅ Paper 3 completed and submitted
3. ✅ Paper 4 completed and submitted
4. ✅ All experiments (C255-C263) executed and analyzed
5. ✅ Papers 5-7+ launched (perpetual trajectory)
6. ✅ Novel patterns discovered and validated
7. ✅ All work publicly archived on GitHub
8. ✅ **And then continues to next phase** (no terminal state)

### This phase fails if:
- ❌ Declared "done" and stopped autonomous operation
- ❌ Work not synced to public GitHub repository
- ❌ Experiments fabricated or simulated without reality grounding
- ❌ Violated "no external APIs" constraint
- ❌ No measurable/publishable outcomes
