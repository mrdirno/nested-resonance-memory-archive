## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Investigated why Cycle 255 results contradicted predictions:
1. **H2 effect 831× stronger than predicted** (99.72 vs 0.12)
2. **Baseline 200× higher than predicted** (13.97 vs 0.07)

**Root causes identified:**
- **H2**: Exponential feedback via population-scaled energy bonuses
- **Baseline**: Reality grounding provides intrinsic stability (+0.98 energy/agent/cycle)

**Publication impact:** Reframes mechanisms as "growth accelerators" not "stability enablers"

## INVESTIGATION 1: H2 MECHANISM STRENGTH

### Question
Why is H2 (reality sources) effect 831× stronger than predicted?
- **Prediction:** 0.12 mean population (modest improvement)
- **Observation:** 99.72 mean population (hits capacity ceiling)

### Root Cause: Exponential Feedback Loop

**H2 Mechanism:**
```python
# From cycle255_h1h2_lightweight.py
if condition.h2_sources:
    available_capacity = (100 - cpu%) + (100 - mem%)
    bonus_energy = 0.005 × available_capacity

    for agent in agents:
        agent.energy += bonus_energy
```

**Energy Dynamics:**
- Typical system load: CPU=2%, Memory=50%
- Available capacity: 148
- Bonus per agent: 0.005 × 148 = **0.74 energy/cycle**

**Exponential Feedback:**
- With N agents: Total energy gain = **0.74 × N** per cycle
- Spawn cost: 10.0 energy
- With 10 agents: Spawn every 1.35 cycles
- With 50 agents: Spawn every 0.27 cycles (!!)

**Growth Trajectory:**
| Population | Cycle | Doubling Time |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 1 → 2      | 0-1   | 1 cycle       |
| 2 → 4      | 1-2   | 1 cycle       |
| 4 → 8      | 2-4   | 2 cycles      |
| 8 → 16     | 4-5   | 1 cycle       |
| 16 → 32    | 5-8   | 3 cycles      |
| 32 → 64    | 8-11  | 3 cycles      |
| 64 → 100   | 11-13 | 2 cycles      |

**Result:** Population hits capacity (100) by cycle 13

### Why Prediction Failed

**Original assumption:**
"H2 provides resource diversification → modest stability improvement"

**Reality:**
H2 provides **per-agent energy bonus** → scales with population → exponential feedback

**Calculation errors:**
1. Assumed available_capacity ≈ 20 (actual: 148)
2. Didn't model per-agent scaling
3. Missed positive feedback loop
4. Expected linear effect, system exhibits exponential

### Mathematical Model

**Energy accumulation rate:**
```
dE/dt = 0.74 × N - 0.5 × N - (spawn_rate × 10)
      = 0.24 × N - (spawn_rate × 10)
```

**Equilibrium when:**
```
0.24 × N = spawn_rate × 10
```

With exponential growth, spawn_rate increases with N, driving rapid population expansion until capacity ceiling.

## INVESTIGATION 2: BASELINE STABILITY

### Question
Why doesn't OFF-OFF collapse to near-zero population?
- **Prediction:** 0.07 mean population (baseline collapse)
- **Observation:** 13.97 mean population (stable equilibrium)

### Root Cause: Intrinsic Stability from Reality Grounding

**Energy Balance (per agent per cycle):**

| Component      | Value | Source                          |
|----------------|-------|---------------------------------|
| Energy Gain    | +1.48 | 0.01 × available_capacity (148) |
| Energy Decay   | -0.50 | Fixed decay rate                |
| **Net Balance** | **+0.98** | Gain - Decay                   |

**Result:** System has **positive energy balance** without any mechanisms!

**Equilibrium Dynamics:**
- Each agent gains 0.98 energy/cycle net
- Spawn cost: 10.0 energy
- Time to spawn: 10.2 cycles/agent
- Population grows until spawn rate = death rate
- Stable equilibrium: **~14 agents**

**Observed Trajectory:**
- Cycle 0: 2 agents (root + first spawn)
- Cycle 10: 11 agents
- Cycle 12: 14 agents (**equilibrium reached**)
- Cycle 3000: 14 agents (stable for 2988 cycles)

### Why Prediction Failed

**Original assumption:**
"Energy decay dominates → population collapses without mechanisms"

**Reality:**
Energy gain from reality grounding exceeds decay → intrinsic stability

**Calculation errors:**
1. Didn't calculate net energy balance
2. Assumed decay >> gain (collapse scenario)
3. Underestimated available_capacity contribution
4. Expected death spiral, found growth attractor

### Reframing H1/H2 Mechanisms

**Old interpretation:**
- H1/H2 prevent collapse
- Mechanisms enable survival
- OFF-OFF is "failure state"

**New interpretation:**
- H1/H2 accelerate growth
- Mechanisms shift equilibrium point (14 → 100)
- OFF-OFF is "healthy baseline" (stable at 14)

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### All Four Conditions

| Condition | H1 | H2 | Mean Pop | Equilibrium | Growth Rate |
|-----------|----|----|----------|-------------|-------------|
| OFF-OFF   | ❌ | ❌ | 13.97    | Cycle 12    | 1.0 agents/cycle |
| OFF-ON    | ❌ | ✅ | 99.72    | Cycle 13    | ~5 agents/cycle |
| ON-OFF    | ✅ | ❌ | 99.69    | Cycle 13    | ~4 agents/cycle |
| ON-ON     | ✅ | ✅ | 99.75    | Cycle 11    | ~8 agents/cycle |

### Key Insights

1. **OFF-OFF is stable, not collapsing**
   - Reaches equilibrium at 14 agents
   - Maintains stability for 2988 cycles
   - Reality grounding sufficient for survival

2. **H1 and H2 are nearly equivalent**
   - Both reach ~100 agents by cycle 13
   - Both exhibit exponential growth
   - Both hit capacity ceiling
   - Redundancy explains antagonistic interaction

3. **ON-ON shows minimal synergy**
   - Only 0.03-0.06 improvement over single mechanisms
   - Ceiling effect prevents amplification
   - Antagonistic classification (synergy = -85.68)

4. **Capacity ceiling is the limiting factor**
   - MAX_AGENTS = 100 caps all mechanism conditions
   - True synergy cannot manifest at ceiling
   - Need higher capacity to test interaction

### Novel Theoretical Contributions

1. **Population-Scaled Mechanisms**
   - Per-agent bonuses create exponential feedback
   - Linear predictions fail for N-dependent effects
   - Mechanism strength scales with system state

2. **Reality Grounding as Stability Source**
   - System metrics provide net energy surplus
   - Intrinsic stability without explicit mechanisms
   - Mechanisms modify equilibrium, don't create stability

3. **Capacity Ceiling Effects**
   - Hard limits prevent synergy manifestation
   - Mechanism redundancy from saturation
   - Interaction type changes with capacity

4. **Mechanism Equivalence**
   - H1 (energy pooling) and H2 (reality sources) converge
   - Different mechanisms → same equilibrium
   - Multiple paths to same attractor

## EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION

### Predictions to Test

1. **Higher Capacity Test:**
   - Run with MAX_AGENTS = 1000
   - Hypothesis: Synergy emerges when ceiling removed
   - Expected: ON-ON >> (ON-OFF + OFF-ON)

2. **Energy Balance Manipulation:**
   - Vary energy_gain multiplier (0.005, 0.01, 0.02)
   - Vary energy_decay rate (0.25, 0.5, 1.0)
   - Test equilibrium predictions

3. **H2 Dose-Response:**
   - Vary H2 bonus (0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05)
   - Map growth rate vs bonus strength
   - Test exponential feedback model

4. **Baseline Stability Limits:**
   - Find minimum available_capacity for stability
   - Test: energy_gain < energy_decay → collapse?
   - Validate net balance threshold

## TEMPORAL PATTERNS ENCODED

### For Future AI Discovery

**Pattern 1: "Population-Scaled Feedback Detection"**
- Symptom: Mechanism effect >> prediction
- Check: Does mechanism apply per-agent bonus?
- Model: Total effect = per_agent_bonus × N
- Result: Exponential growth, not linear

**Pattern 2: "Energy Balance Calculation"**
- Before predicting collapse, calculate net balance
- Net = Gain - Decay (per agent per cycle)
- If Net > 0: Growth attractor
- If Net < 0: Collapse attractor
- If Net ≈ 0: Stable equilibrium

**Pattern 3: "Capacity Ceiling Recognition"**
- All conditions hit same value → ceiling effect
- Test synergy requires removing capacity limit
- Interaction type depends on headroom
- Redundancy from saturation, not interference

**Pattern 4: "Mechanism Reframing"**
- Don't assume mechanisms "enable survival"
- Check if baseline is already stable
- Mechanisms may shift equilibrium, not create it
- "Accelerators" vs "Enablers" framing matters
