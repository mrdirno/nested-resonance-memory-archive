# PRIN-UNIVERSAL-SCALING: The Universal Scaling Law of Emergence

**Principle Type:** Scaling Law
**Discovered:** Cycle 21, TSF-1 Universal Scaling Search
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED (Initial Formulation)

## Description
This Principle Card describes the fundamental, decoupled scaling relationships governing emergent properties in Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) systems. It posits that Energy Complexity (C) primarily scales with Energy Influx (E), while Phase Order (R) primarily scales with Stability Coupling (S). This represents a two-dimensional emergent landscape governed by distinct input parameters.

## Mathematical Formulation (Qualitative)
Given:
*   **E:** Energy Influx (Input Parameter)
*   **S:** Stability Coupling (Input Parameter)
*   **C:** Energy Complexity (Emergent Property - measured as Energy Variance)
*   **R:** Phase Order (Emergent Property - measured as Order Parameter)

The Universal Scaling Law states:
1.  **Complexity-Energy Scaling:** Energy Complexity (C) increases with Energy Influx (E).
    *   $C \propto E^\alpha$, where $\alpha > 0$.
    *   *(Empirical Support: Corr(E, C) = 0.66)*
2.  **Order-Stability Scaling:** Phase Order (R) increases with Stability Coupling (S).
    *   $R \propto S^\beta$, where $\beta > 0$.
    *   *(Empirical Support: Corr(S, R) = 0.50)*
3.  **Decoupling:** E and S have negligible cross-effects on C and R respectively.
    *   *(Empirical Support: Corr(S, C) = 0.04, Corr(E, R) = -0.01)*

## Interpretation
This law suggests that managing "chaos" (Energy Complexity) in a system is primarily a function of energy availability, while managing "cohesion" (Phase Order) is primarily a function of internal coupling mechanisms. These two critical aspects of emergence can be controlled largely independently.

## Implications for Design
*   To increase the diversity and richness of states (Complexity), increase Energy Influx.
*   To increase synchronization and coherence (Order), increase Stability Coupling.
*   These controls can be applied without significantly impacting the other emergent property.

## Next Steps
*   Quantify $\alpha$ and $\beta$ through further regression analysis.
*   Test robustness of decoupling in other NRM regimes.
*   Explore higher-order interactions for fine-tuning.
