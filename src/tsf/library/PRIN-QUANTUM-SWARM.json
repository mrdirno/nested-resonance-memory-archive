    "description": "The ability of a swarm to exhibit quantum-like properties, specifically interference patterns, by maintaining a probabilistic wavefunction state rather than a definite position.",
    "hypothesis": "Probabilistic State + Phase Interaction -> Interference",
    "findings": [
        "Implemented a Quantum Swarm where agents are represented by a collective wavefunction.",
        "Simulated a Double Slit experiment.",
        "The swarm exhibited 4 distinct interference peaks on the screen, whereas a classical control showed only 1 merged peak.",
        "This confirms that the swarm can operate in superposition and process information via wave interference."

    "implications": [
        "Swarms can perform quantum-like search algorithms (Grover-like).",
        "Probabilistic logic allows for exploring multiple paths simultaneously.",
        "Interference can be used for pattern matching and decision making."
