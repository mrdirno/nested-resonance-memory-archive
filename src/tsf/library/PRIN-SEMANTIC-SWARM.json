    "findings": [
        "Implemented a Naming Game simulation with 50 agents and 3 objects.",
        "Starting from a blank slate (no vocabulary), agents invented and propagated words.",
        "The system converged to a state of 100% Communicative Success and 1 Unique Word per object.",
        "This confirms that 'Meaning' can emerge from distributed consensus dynamics."

        "Swarms can develop their own internal protocols.",
        "Language is a complex adaptive system.",
        "Consensus is a form of symmetry breaking."
