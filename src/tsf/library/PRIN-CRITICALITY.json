    "findings": [
        "Implemented Integrate-and-Fire dynamics in the swarm.",
        "Observed that activity avalanches follow a Power Law distribution (alpha ~ 2.31).",
        "The system naturally maintains itself at the 'Edge of Chaos' without external tuning of the control parameter.",
        "This confirms that the swarm is optimized for computation and responsiveness."

    "implications": [
        "Swarms are scale-free systems.",
        "Information can propagate over long distances (correlation length diverges).",
        "The system is robust to failures (no single point of failure)."
