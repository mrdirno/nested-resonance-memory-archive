**Experiments:** 6
**Status:** COMPLETE - STABLE FIVE-LEVEL COEXISTENCE

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Five-level food chain achieves stable equilibrium.**

- Four-trophic: 300-30-10-5 (100% stable)
- Five-trophic: 300-30-10-5-3 (equilibrium maintained)

Linear food chains can extend to at least five levels.

## RESULTS

| Condition | Prey | Meso | Top | Apex | Hyper | Outcome |
|-----------|------|------|-----|------|-------|---------|
| Four-trophic | 300 | 30 | 10 | 5 | - | 100% stable |
| Five-trophic | 300 | 30 | 10 | 5 | 3 | Equilibrium |

All three five-trophic runs reached identical equilibrium: 300-30-10-5-3.

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Stable Five-Trophic Equilibrium

Five levels coexist at stable equilibrium:
- Prey: 300 (50% of K)
- Mesopredator: 30
- Top predator: 10
- Apex predator: 5
- Hyper predator: 3

### 2. Trophic Efficiency

Population ratios follow decreasing efficiency:
- L0→L1: 10% (30/300)
- L1→L2: 33% (10/30)
- L2→L3: 50% (5/10)
- L3→L4: 60% (3/5)

Higher levels have higher proportional transfer.

### 3. Lower Levels Unchanged

Adding fifth level didn't change lower equilibria:
- Same prey, meso, top, apex populations
- Hyper predator "fits in" at top

### 4. Small Top Population

Hyper predator population = 3:
- Near demographic stochasticity threshold
- Vulnerable to random extinction
- At edge of viability

## MECHANISM

### Five-Level Energy Flow

```
Prey (L0): 300 individuals
    ↓ ~10% efficiency
Meso (L1): 30 individuals
    ↓ ~33% efficiency
Top (L2): 10 individuals
    ↓ ~50% efficiency
Apex (L3): 5 individuals
    ↓ ~60% efficiency
Hyper (L4): 3 individuals
```

### Why Five Works

1. Parameters in viable zone at each level
2. Type II functional response prevents overexploitation
3. Linear chain (no omnivory)
4. Sufficient prey base

---

## THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE

### 1. No Inherent Chain Length Limit

Food chains can extend beyond four levels:
- Not limited by "three-level maximum"
- Parameters determine stability
- Five levels achievable

### 2. Energy Limitation at Top

Top consumer population very small:
- Only 3 individuals
- 1% of prey population
- At stochastic extinction risk

### 3. Ecosystem Implications

Long food chains possible when:
- High productivity at base
- Parameters optimized at each level
- No cross-level interactions

## UPDATED TOTALS

| Campaign | Experiments | Findings |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| C274-C314 | 1312 | Multi-trophic + prey dynamics |
| C315 | 6 | Five-trophic stability |
| **Total** | **1318** | **Five-level food chain** |

---

## NEXT DIRECTIONS

1. **Six-trophic**: Can stability extend further?
2. **Hyper extinction risk**: Test demographic stochasticity
3. **Productivity gradient**: Does higher prey K allow more levels?

---

## CONCLUSION

C315 establishes that **five-level food chains can achieve stable equilibrium** in NRM.

Key findings:
1. Equilibrium at 300-30-10-5-3
2. Lower levels unchanged by adding fifth
3. Top consumer at demographic threshold (N=3)
4. Linear chains can extend beyond four levels

This extends the multi-trophic framework to five levels, though the top consumer is at the edge of viability due to small population size.
