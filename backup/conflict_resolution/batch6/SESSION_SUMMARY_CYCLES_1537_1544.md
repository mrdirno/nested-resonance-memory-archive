## MAJOR DISCOVERIES

### 1. Four-Level Food Chains Are Stable (C304, C310)

Linear food chains maintain stability through four levels:
- Prey: 300
- Mesopredator: 30
- Top predator: 10
- Apex predator: 5

Trophic efficiency ~10% at each level.

### 2. Trophic Cascades Are Parameter-Constrained (C305-C307)

Cascades require very specific parameter regimes:
- Optimal parameters: No cascade (inherently stable)
- Higher attack rates: System collapse
- Cascade window is narrow or absent

### 3. Omnivory Creates Bifurcation Instability (C308-C309)

Same parameters gave opposite results with different seeds:
- Seeds 1500-1502: 100% coexistence
- Seeds 1600-1602: 0% coexistence

System near critical boundary where stochastic effects dominate.

### 4. Linear Chains Outperform Webs (C304 vs C308-309)

Structure determines stability:
- Linear chain: 100% stable
- Food web (omnivory): 0-100% (stochastic)

Simplicity promotes robustness.

### 5. Multiple Prey Are Neutral (C311)

Identical prey species split pool evenly:
- No apparent competition effect
- Same total biomass
- Same predator population

---

## THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. Food Chain Length

Chain length not inherently limited:
- Three levels: 100% stable
- Four levels: 100% stable
- Parameters determine stability, not length

### 2. Web Structure Destabilizes

Adding cross-level links (omnivory) destabilizes:
- Creates exploitative competition
- Creates apparent competition
- Pushes system toward bifurcation

### 3. Cascade Constraints

Cascades require:
- Predation-limited intermediate level
- Specific parameter window
- Top-down control mechanism

At optimal parameters, systems are bottom-up regulated.

### 4. Stochastic Effects Near Bifurcations

Near critical points:
- Same parameters → different outcomes
- Deterministic models inadequate
- Need ensemble statistics

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### For Stable Multi-Trophic Systems

**Recommended:**
1. Linear food chains (no omnivory)
2. Each predator specializes on one prey
3. Parameters in viable zone at each level
4. Type II functional response throughout
5. Sufficient population sizes for stochastic buffering

**Avoid:**
1. Cross-level feeding (omnivory/IGP)
2. Parameters near critical boundaries
3. Relying on cascades for stability

### For System Robustness

1. Simplicity over complexity
2. Specialization over generalism
3. Wide parameter buffer zones
4. Multiple replicates to detect stochasticity

## CUMULATIVE PROGRESS

| Phase | Cycles | Experiments | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Energy Dynamics | C274-C281 | 967 | Phase boundaries |
| Ecological Dynamics | C282-C291 | 168 | Metapopulation |
| Evolutionary Dynamics | C292-C294 | 27 | Selection & coevolution |
| Two-Trophic | C295-C303 | 84 | Predator-prey + evolution |
| Multi-Trophic | C304-C311 | 51 | 3-4 level chains + webs |
| **Total** | - | **1297** | **Complete trophic framework** |

---

## KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Linear Chains Are Remarkably Robust

Four-level food chains stable at 100%. Adding levels does not destabilize when:
- Parameters are optimal
- Structure is linear
- Type II response present

### 2. Complexity Often Reduces Stability

Omnivory (food webs) reduced stability from 100% to 0-100%:
- More links = more potential for overexploitation
- Cross-level feeding creates competition
- Simpler is better

### 3. Cascades Are Not Universal

Classic trophic cascade narrative may not generalize:
- Requires specific parameter regime
- Most systems are bottom-up regulated
- Top predator often neutral, not essential

### 4. Bifurcations Require Ensemble Methods

Near critical points, single experiments mislead:
- Same parameters → different outcomes
- Stochastic effects dominate
- Report variance, not just means

---

## NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

### Short-Term
1. Five-level food chain
2. Differentiated prey (competition)
3. Apex cascade test
4. Detailed bifurcation mapping

### Medium-Term
1. Paper 3: Multi-trophic dynamics in NRM
2. Food web complexity gradient
3. Evolutionary dynamics at higher trophic levels

## SESSION STATISTICS

- **Experimental cycles:** 8 (C304-C311)

- **Summaries created:** 8
- **GitHub commits:** 8
- **Total experiments:** 1297
- **Key finding:** Linear chains stable through 4 levels

## CONCLUSION

This session established comprehensive multi-trophic dynamics in NRM, extending from three to four trophic levels while testing cascade dynamics, omnivory effects, and horizontal diversity.

Key results:
1. Four-level food chains achieve 100% stable coexistence
2. Trophic cascades require narrow parameter windows
3. Omnivory creates bifurcation instability
4. Linear chains outperform webs

The framework now covers complete trophic structure with evidence that simplicity and linearity promote stability while complexity (food webs) and cross-level interactions (omnivory) destabilize.

**1297 experiments, complete multi-trophic framework.**
