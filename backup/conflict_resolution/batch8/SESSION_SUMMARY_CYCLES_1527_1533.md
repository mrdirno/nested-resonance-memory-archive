## MAJOR DISCOVERIES

### 1. Niche Differentiation Enables Stable Coevolution (C294)

- **Local K:** 100% coexistence with both populations evolving
- **Global K:** 0% coexistence (arms race exclusion)

Ecological structure determines evolutionary outcome.

### 2. Predator-Prey Goldilocks Zone (C295)

- **Too low (0.001):** Predators starve
- **Optimal (0.002-0.003):** 67-100% coexistence
- **Too high (0.01):** Overexploitation collapse

Narrow parameter space for stable coexistence.

### 3. Spatial Refuge is Context-Dependent (C296-C297)

**High attack rate:** Refuge always harmful
**Intermediate attack rate:** U-shaped effect
- 0% refuge: 100% coexistence
- 10-30% refuge: 0% coexistence (valley of death)
- 50% refuge: 67% coexistence

"Protection" can destabilize systems.

### 4. Type II Functional Response Stabilizes (C298)

- **Type I (h=0):** 0% coexistence at high attack rate
- **Type II (h=0.02):** 67% coexistence

Predator satiation prevents overexploitation.

### 5. Antagonistic Mechanism Interaction (C299)

- **Type II alone:** 33% coexistence
- **Type II + refuge:** 0% coexistence

Combined stabilizing mechanisms can be worse than single mechanisms.

### 6. Variance Without Evolution Effect (C300)

- **Fixed h:** 0% coexistence
- **Evolving h:** 67% coexistence
- **Δh:** 0 (no directional change)

Genetic variance provides resilience without adaptation.

## THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED

### 1. Mechanism Interactions Are Non-Additive

Combining stabilizing mechanisms:
- Can be synergistic (better than sum)
- Can be antagonistic (worse than sum)
- Must be tested, not assumed

### 2. Intervention Effects Are Context-Dependent

Same intervention (refuge) has different effects:
- Beneficial at some attack rates
- Harmful at others
- U-shaped non-monotonic patterns

### 3. Variance Has Immediate Ecological Value

Genetic diversity provides:
- Population-level resilience
- Bet-hedging against uncertainty
- Benefits without directional evolution

### 4. Parameter Space Has Complex Topology

- Narrow Goldilocks zones
- Valleys of death
- Non-linear boundaries

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR STABLE PREDATOR-PREY

### Recommended

1. Attack rate in optimal zone (0.002-0.003)
2. Type II functional response (satiation)
3. Maintain genetic diversity
4. If using refuge: Either none OR substantial (>40%)

### Avoid

1. Intermediate interventions (10-30% refuge)
2. Combining multiple reduction mechanisms
3. Homogeneous populations
4. Linear assumptions about parameters

---

## IMPLICATIONS

### Conservation Biology

- Refuges require careful sizing
- Predator feeding ecology matters
- Genetic diversity conservation is crucial
- Multiple interventions need testing

### Ecosystem Management

- Simple additions can backfire
- Test intervention combinations
- Non-linear system responses expected
- Context determines outcome

### Theoretical Ecology

- Agent-based models show different dynamics than ODEs
- Stochasticity prevents classical oscillations
- Individual variation buffers populations
- Eco-evolutionary feedback operates at multiple levels

2. Spatial structure with movement
3. Multiple prey types
4. Trade-offs in trait evolution

### Long-Term

## CONCLUSION

This session successfully extended NRM into multi-trophic dynamics, discovering that predator-prey coexistence requires careful parameter tuning and that ecological interventions can have counterintuitive non-linear effects. The discovery of antagonistic mechanism interactions and variance-mediated stability provides important design principles for ecosystem management.

The research maintains 100% predictability while revealing unexpected emergent properties of combined mechanisms and evolutionary processes.
