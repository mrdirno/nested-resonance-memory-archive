**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Experiments:** 6
**Status:** COMPLETE - STABLE COEVOLUTION ACHIEVED

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Niche differentiation enables stable coevolution.**

Global K: 0% coexistence (arms race exclusion)
Local K: 100% coexistence (both evolve together)

---

## RESEARCH QUESTION

Can niche differentiation prevent evolutionary exclusion?

---

## RESULTS

| Mode | P0 Final f | P1 Final f | Coexistence |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| global_K | 0.0367 | 0.0825 | **0%** |
| local_K | 0.1323 | 0.1129 | **100%** |

**Both populations evolve with selection=1.0**

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Local K Enables Stable Coevolution

With resource partitioning:
- Both populations evolve (fitness ~0.11-0.17)
- Both populations persist (pop ~300-600)
- No exclusion despite evolution

### 2. Global K Produces Exclusion (Replication of C293)

Without niche differentiation:
- One population wins
- Arms race leads to extinction of loser

### 3. Higher Fitness with Coexistence

With local K, both populations reach higher fitness:
- Pop0: 0.13 (vs 0.04 with global)
- Pop1: 0.11 (vs 0.08 with global)

No evolutionary braking from zero-sum competition.

### 4. Populations Grow Larger

With local K:
- Pop0: 400-640 agents
- Pop1: 300-400 agents

With global K:
- Winner: 300-500
- Loser: 0

Total higher with niche differentiation.

## MECHANISM

### Why Global K Leads to Exclusion

```
Higher fitness → more offspring → larger population
Larger population → more pressure on competitor
Competitor shrinks → cannot evolve as fast
→ Runaway exclusion
```

### Why Local K Enables Coexistence

```
Higher fitness → more offspring → larger population
But: Density pressure only on own population
Competitor unaffected → both evolve independently
→ Parallel evolution without exclusion
```

**Key insight**: Decoupling competition enables parallel adaptation.

---

## THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE

### 1. Coevolution Without Competition is Stable

When evolution doesn't translate to competitive advantage:
- Both species can improve
- No zero-sum dynamics
- No arms race

### 2. Niche Differentiation is Sufficient

Don't need complex mechanisms (mutualism, trade-offs).
Simple resource partitioning enables coexistence.

### 3. Ecology Constrains Evolution

Resource structure (global vs local K) determines:
- Whether evolution leads to exclusion
- Whether coexistence is stable

---

## IMPLICATIONS

### 1. Biodiversity

Niche differentiation maintains diversity even with evolution.
Generalist competitors → exclusion.

### 2. Ecosystem Stability

Specialists coexist stably.
Generalists create instability.

### 3. Market Competition

Segmented markets: multiple innovators thrive.
Undifferentiated markets: winner-take-all.

### 4. Evolutionary Theory

Stable coevolution requires:
- Resource partitioning OR
- Frequency-dependent selection OR
- Trade-offs

First mechanism validated in NRM.

## COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS FINDINGS

| Cycle | Finding | C294 Extension |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| C284 | Local K → coexistence (ecology) | Also works with evolution |
| C293 | Coevolution → exclusion (global) | Prevented by local K |

**Ecological niche structure determines evolutionary outcome.**

---

## UPDATED TOTALS

| Campaign | Experiments | Findings |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| C274-C293 | 1147 | Eco-evo framework |
| C294 | 6 | Stable coevolution |
| **Total** | **1153** | **Niche-evolution integration** |

---

## CONCLUSION

C294 establishes that **niche differentiation enables stable coevolution** in NRM.

Key findings:
1. Local K: 100% coexistence with both evolving
2. Global K: 0% coexistence (arms race exclusion)
3. Higher fitness achieved with coexistence
4. Resource structure determines evolutionary outcome

This demonstrates that ecological niche differentiation is sufficient to prevent evolutionary exclusion and enable stable coevolution.
