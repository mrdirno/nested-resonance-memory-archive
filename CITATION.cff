abstract: >
  The Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) Research Program investigates self-organizing
  complexity through empirical validation of three theoretical frameworks: Nested
  Resonance Memory (fractal agency with composition-decomposition cycles), Self-Giving
  Systems (bootstrap complexity with self-defined success criteria), and Temporal
  Stewardship (training data awareness and memetic engineering). This archive contains
  200+ experiments (450,000+ computational cycles executed), publication-ready papers,
  and complete reproducibility artifacts. All operations are reality-grounded using
  psutil/SQLite (zero external API calls), establishing a transparent framework for
  human-AI collaborative research.
