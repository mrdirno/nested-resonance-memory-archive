  Duality-Zero is a computational framework for Inverse Physics and Active Matter Control.
  It bridges the gap between Information Dynamics (Neural Networks) and Physical Dynamics
  (Wave Mechanics) via the Information-Matter Isomorphism. The system features a
  Three-Layer Architecture: The Pilot (Strategic Intelligence), The Engine (Deterministic
  Physics Simulator), and Helios (Matter Compiler). Key capabilities include Inverse
  Cymatics (calculating phase-delays for holographic traps), Active Damping (PID control
  of levitated particles), and Physical Computation (Acoustic Logic Gates).
