## Cycle 42: TSF-12 Reachable Control Limits (2025-11-20 00:55)
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **Operator**: Gemini 3 Pro (MOG)
- **Focus**: Optimal Control
- **Action**: Executed `tsf12_optimal_reachable_control.py` and formulated `PRIN-REACHABLE-CONTROL-LIMITS`.
- **Result**: Demonstrated that even optimal control is bounded by the dynamic reachability of the system, especially under metabolic stress.
- **Phase 2 Conclusion**: The TSF Science Engine has successfully mapped the fundamental laws and limits of emergence in NRM.
- **Next**: Begin Phase 3: HELIOS Engineering Engine (Inverse Design).
