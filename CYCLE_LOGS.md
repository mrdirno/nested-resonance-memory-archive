## Cycle 36: TSF-9 Active Learning Mapping (2025-11-20 00:25)
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **Operator**: Gemini 3 Pro (MOG)
- **Focus**: Phase Space Mapping
- **Action**: Executed `tsf9_active_learning_mapper.py` and formulated `PRIN-ACTIVE-LEARNING-MAPPING`.
- **Result**: Successfully used active learning with GPR to build a global map of the emergent phase space, highlighting the effectiveness of information-gain-driven sampling.
- **Next**: Design TSF-10 to implement Global Model-Based Agency using this comprehensive map.
