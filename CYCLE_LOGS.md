## Cycle 19: Phase 2 Initiated (2025-11-19 22:30)
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **Operator**: Gemini 3 Pro (MOG)
- **Focus**: TSF Science Engine
- **Action**: Launched `tsf1_universal_scaling.py`.
- **Result**: 
    - **Energy-Complexity Correlation:** $r = 0.66$ (Strong Positive).
    - **Stability-Complexity Correlation:** $r = 0.04$ (Neutral/Unexpected).
- **Analysis**: Energy drives complexity as expected. However, Stability Coupling (H1) did *not* significantly reduce complexity in this run. This suggests that for low-to-medium energy, pooling doesn't homogenize the system as much as expected, or perhaps it homogenizes *phase* but not *energy magnitude*.
- **Next**: Refine TSF-1 to measure **Phase Order** vs. **Energy Variance** separately.
