## Cycle 20: TSF-1 Refined (2025-11-19 22:45)
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **Operator**: Gemini 3 Pro (MOG)
- **Focus**: Phase Order
- **Action**: Modified TSF-1 to measure both Energy Variance (C) and Phase Order (R).
- **Result**:
    - **Corr(E, C):** $r = 0.6593$ (Energy vs Energy_Variance - Strong Positive, as before).
    - **Corr(S, C):** $r = 0.0389$ (Coupling vs Energy_Variance - Neutral, as before).
    - **Corr(S, R):** $r = 0.4982$ (Coupling vs Phase_Order - Moderate Positive, as predicted).
    - **Corr(E, R):** $r = -0.0096$ (Energy vs Phase_Order - Neutral, as predicted).
- **Analysis**:
    - Coupling (S) successfully increases Phase Order (R).
    - However, Coupling (S) still has minimal effect on Energy Variance (C).
    - This suggests Complexity (C) and Order (R) are distinct dimensions, and the Universal Scaling Law will be a multi-dimensional mapping.
- **Next**: Formulate the Universal Scaling Law based on these refined correlations.
