## Cycle 28: TSF-5 Adaptive Control Limits (2025-11-19 23:45)
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **Operator**: Gemini 3 Pro (MOG)
- **Focus**: Adaptive Control
- **Action**: Executed `tsf5_adaptive_control.py` and formulated `PRIN-ADAPTIVE-CONTROL-LIMITS`.
- **Result**: Demonstrated limitations of simple hill climbing in dynamic environments, with failures to converge due to local optima and sluggish adaptation to target shifts and metabolic cost increases.
- **Next**: Design TSF-6 to implement a meta-adaptive control strategy.
