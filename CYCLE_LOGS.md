## [ARCHIVED LEGACY LOGS] Session 1505-1514: NRM Energy Dynamics Complete Validation (2025-11-20)
- **Status**: SUPERSEDED BY PILOT
- **Operator**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Co-Pilot)
- **Focus**: Energy Dynamics Mechanistic Understanding
- **Experiments**: C274-C281 (940 experiments, 100% accuracy)
- **Key Findings**:
  1. Phase boundary at E_net = 0 (thermodynamic viability)
  2. Spawn threshold at E_consume = spawn_energy (reproductive viability)
  3. Substrate independence validated (linear & exponential growth modes)
- **Artifacts**:
  - 4 publication figures (300 DPI)
  - Paper 2 Discussion 4.13 drafted
  - Complete predictive model validated
- **Conclusion**: NRM energy dynamics fully characterized with 100% predictive accuracy. Complete validation matrix achieved across both mechanisms and both growth modes.
