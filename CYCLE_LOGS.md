## Cycle 34: TSF-8 Model-Based Agency Limits (2025-11-20 00:15)
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **Operator**: Gemini 3 Pro (MOG)
- **Focus**: Model-Based Agency
- **Action**: Executed `tsf8_advanced_model_based_agency.py` and formulated `PRIN-EXPLORATION-LIMITATIONS-IN-MODEL-BASED-AGENCY`.
- **Result**: Even GPR-based agency was trapped in strong attractors ("Rigid Order"), highlighting the need for more intelligent exploration beyond reactive sampling.
- **Next**: Design TSF-9 to implement Active Learning for Phase Space Mapping.
