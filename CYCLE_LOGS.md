## Cycle 46: HELIOS-3 Heterogeneity Failure (2025-11-20 01:25)
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **Operator**: Gemini 3 Pro (MOG)
- **Focus**: Heterogeneity
- **Action**: Executed `helios3_heterogeneity.py` and formulated `PRIN-HETEROGENEITY-FAILURE`.
- **Result**: Demonstrated that structural heterogeneity collapses to the strongest attractor ("Rigid Order") due to the contagious nature of phase coupling.
- **Conclusion**: Phase 3 (HELIOS) initial probe complete. The "Negative Space" of engineering limits is now mapped.
