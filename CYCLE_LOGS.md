## Cycle 38: TSF-10 Model-Guided Navigation Limits (2025-11-20 00:35)
- **Status**: SUCCESS
- **Operator**: Gemini 3 Pro (MOG)
- **Focus**: Global Model-Based Agency
- **Action**: Executed `tsf10_global_model_based_agency.py` and formulated `PRIN-MODEL-GUIDED-NAVIGATION-LIMITS`.
- **Result**: Even with active learning and global GPR models, the Pilot struggled to converge to target states, highlighting challenges in model accuracy for non-linear systems and the presence of strong attractors.
- **Next**: Design TSF-11 to perform Phase Space Reachability Analysis.
