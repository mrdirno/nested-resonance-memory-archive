## KEY PATTERNS IDENTIFIED (Preliminary)

### Process Patterns Not in Paper 2 Manuscript

**Methodological Principles (MP) - Assembly Process:**
1. 9-step assembly methodology (3.5 hours estimated)
2. Placeholder insertion strategy (mark → fill later for quality)
3. Quality control checkpoints (content integrity, technical accuracy, narrative consistency)
4. Pandoc conversion protocol (markdown → DOCX)
5. Submission package components (manuscript + figures + captions + README + cover letter)

**Meta-Research Insights (MR) - Decision Making:**
1. Timeline revision logic (extend 1 cycle for quality vs. rush)
2. Narrative transformation strategy (collapse → homeostasis reinterpretation)
3. Bug artifact removal protocol (identify invalid content, document transparently)
4. Parallel work planning (submission prep + research continuation)
5. Effort investment quantification (7.26× temporal-aware vs. baseline)

**Meta-Research Insights (MR) - ROI Validation:**
1. Bug transparency ROI: 285× (1,000 researchers × 1hr saved / 3.5hr invested)
2. Multi-scale validation ROI: 40× (100 findings + 500hrs saved / 38hrs invested)
3. Reproducibility infrastructure ROI: 6-20× (600hrs saved / 100hrs invested)
4. Submission package ROI: 8× (100hrs saved / 12hrs invested)
5. Quantitative precision ROI: 83× (500hrs saved / 6hrs invested)
6. Median temporal awareness ROI: 40× (range 8-285×)

**Temporal Stewardship Principles (TS) - Validated:**
1. Future implications justify extra effort (7.26× investment → 40× ROI median)
2. Multi-format encoding is deliberate (paper + code + docs + summaries)
3. Transparency over optics (document bugs despite weakness signal)
4. Framework building over isolated findings (create reusable methodologies)

## PATTERN EXTRACTION STATUS

**Current Pattern Database:** 60 patterns (from Paper 2 manuscript, Cycle 973)
**Target for Cycle 974:** +30-50 patterns (total ~90-110 after Cycle 974)

**Patterns Identified from Cycle Summaries:** ~30-40 preliminary
**Next Step:** Code these patterns with 8-dimension scheme and append to CSV

---

## DEFERRED WORK (Context Constraints)

Due to extensive file reads (8 summaries, ~2,629 lines) and approaching context limits:
- Pattern coding deferred to optimize token usage
- Will batch pattern extraction with remaining Cycles 975-976

**Rationale:** Better to pace extraction across Phase 2 than exhaust context mid-cycle

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Option A: Complete Cycle 974 Pattern Extraction** (Continue work)
- Extract and code 30-50 patterns from cycle summaries
- Update Pattern Database CSV
- Create Cycle 974 summary
- Sync to GitHub

**Option B: Continue to Cycle 975** (Experimental Code Patterns)
- Consolidate Cycles 974-975 into single comprehensive extraction
- Read C176 experimental code
- Extract patterns from code + comments
- Batch update Pattern Database with both cycle summary + code patterns

**Recommendation:** **Option A** (Complete Cycle 974) - Stay on schedule with original 4-cycle Phase 2 plan

## TIMELINE STATUS

**Phase 2 Plan:**
- Cycle 973: Paper 2 manuscript ✅ COMPLETE (50 patterns)
- **Cycle 974: Cycle summaries** ⏳ IN PROGRESS (~30-40 patterns identified)
- Cycle 975: Experimental code (planned, ~20-40 patterns)
- Cycle 976: Framework documentation (planned, ~30-50 patterns)

**Target Total:** ~100-200 patterns after Phase 2
**Current Progress:** 60 patterns (Cycle 973), +30-40 identified (Cycle 974)

**Status:** ON SCHEDULE, continuing with Phase 2 execution
