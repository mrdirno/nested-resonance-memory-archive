## Overview

Research on emergence in complex computational systems through three frameworks: **Nested Resonance Memory (NRM)**, **Self-Giving Systems**, and **Temporal Stewardship**.

**Hybrid Intelligence:** Collaboration between human researcher (Aldrin Payopay) and AI systems (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT 5, Claude Opus 4.1). All AI contributions explicitly acknowledged.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Nested Resonance Memory (NRM)
Fractal agents undergo composition-decomposition cycles, creating emergence through scale-invariant dynamics.

**Status:** ✅ Empirically validated (450,000+ cycles without equilibrium)

**Key Discovery:** Three dynamical regimes (Bistability, Accumulation, Collapse) with complete birth-death coupling causing catastrophic collapse regardless of energy parameters.

### 2. Self-Giving Systems
Systems that bootstrap their own complexity and define their own success criteria.

**Example:** Population ~17 emerged spontaneously without specification, driving major research breakthroughs.

### 3. Temporal Stewardship
Outputs become training data for future AI. Encode principles deliberately.

**Novel Contribution:** Overhead Authentication Protocol - computational expense as falsifiable proof of reality grounding (±5% validation).

## Current Research

### Publications
- **7 papers** at submission quality
- **Reproducibility:** 9.3/10 (world-class, externally audited)
- **Overhead Authentication:** ±5% achieved

### Active Experiments
- **C186 V6:** Ultra-low frequency hierarchical viability test (currently running)
- **C186 V7/V8:** Migration rate and population count variation studies
- **Paper 3:** Factorial validation (80-85% complete)
