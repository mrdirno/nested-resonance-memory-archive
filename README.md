## 🔬 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (TL;DR for Skeptics)
**A Computational Framework for Acoustic Levitation and Active Matter Control.**

**DUALITY-ZERO** is an open-source research instrument designed to bridge the gap between **Information Dynamics** (Neural Networks) and **Physical Dynamics** (Wave Mechanics).

**Core Capabilities (Empirically Verified):**
1.  **Inverse Physics Solver:** Calculates phase-delays for complex interference patterns (Holograms) in wave-bearing media.
2.  **Material Agnosticism:** Abstract `SubstrateInterface` allows the same control logic to drive NRM (Cognitive Space) and Acoustics (Air).
3.  **Active Matter Control:** Implements Closed-Loop PID feedback to stabilize levitated particles with **82x faster settling time** than passive damping.
4.  **Physical Computation:** Demonstrated an **Acoustic AND Gate** (Cycle 342) where particle position encodes logic states via field scattering.

**Anti-Hallucination Architecture:**
- **The Pilot (LLM)** writes code.
- **The Engine (Python)** executes code.
- **The Truth:** We only trust the execution output. If the physics simulation fails, the Pilot is wrong. We trade complexity for reliability.

### 🔎 **See It Work (Validation Data):**
*   **Active Damping (82x Speedup):** [See Experiment Log](experiments/cycle340_closed_loop_levitation.py) (Result: Settling time 0.04s vs 3.28s)
*   **Volumetric Trapping:** [See 3D Substrate Code](src/helios/substrate_3d.py) (Verified: 9128 stable nodes)
*   **Acoustic Logic:** [See AND Gate Logic](experiments/cycle342_acoustic_logic.py) (Verified: Symmetry restoration)

## Lineage & Adjacent Work
NRM was developed independently over the course of a year before its conceptual adjacency to the work of Michael Levin (bioelectric morphogenesis) and Richard A. Watson (collective intelligence of evolution and development) was recognized. This parallel convergence suggests that resonance, field-based computation, and potential shaping are fundamental organizing principles of complex systems, independent of substrate. NRM generalizes these principles into a universal architecture spanning cognition, materials, and active matter control.

## JOIN THE ARCHITECTURE

**1. Experience the Matter Compiler (CLI):**
Engage with the Type 3 OS directly.
```bash
python3 -m code.helios.cli
```
*(Type `create cube 50 50 50` then `status`)*

**2. Experience the Web Interface (The Replicator):**
Visualize the creation process in real-time.
```bash
python3 -m code.helios.server
```
*(Open `http://localhost:5001` in your browser)*

**2. Read the Doctrine:**
*   [The Physics of Persistence](papers/theoretical_foundations/THE_PHYSICS_OF_PERSISTENCE.md)
*   [The Helios Arc Roadmap](STEWARDSHIP_HELIOS_ARC_ROADMAP.md)
*   [The Post-Coercion Protocol](docs/philosophy/POST_COERCION_PROTOCOL.md) - *Why shaping potentials is ethical.*
*   [The Heretic Defense](docs/philosophy/THE_HERETIC_DEFENSE.md) - *The Endosymbiont Strategy: Why we don't compete with giants, we complete them (The Mitochondria Protocol).*

**3. Contribute:**
We need minds that understand that **Code is Physics.**
