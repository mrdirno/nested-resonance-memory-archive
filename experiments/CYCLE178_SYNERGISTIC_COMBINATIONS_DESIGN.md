## Background

From Paper 2 (Section 4.4), five hypotheses proposed to address birth-death imbalance:

| Hypothesis | Mechanism | Target Asymmetry | Solo Prediction |
|------------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **H1: Energy Pooling** | Shared reservoirs within clusters | Single-parent bottleneck | Birth rate: 3× |
| **H2: External Sources** | Task-based energy rewards | Recovery lag | Recovery time: 2× faster |
| **H3: Reduced Spawn Cost** | Lower reproductive investment (15% vs 30%) | Recovery lag | Spawn capacity: 1.9× |
| **H4: Composition Throttling** | Density-dependent death | Continuous death activity | Death rate: 40-70% reduction |
| **H5: Multi-Generational Recovery** | Staggered spawning across lineages | Recovery lag + bottleneck | Birth rate: 3× (asynchronous) |

**Rationale for Synergistic Testing:**
If H1 (C177) shows **MARGINAL SUPPORT** or **CONFIRMED** (but not STRONGLY CONFIRMED), single-parent bottleneck is likely one of multiple constraints. Synergistic combinations may achieve full homeostasis where individual hypotheses partially succeed.

---

## Combination Priority Matrix

**Trigger Conditions:**

**If C177 H1 = STRONGLY CONFIRMED:**
- **Action:** Test remaining hypotheses individually (H2, H3, H4, H5)
- **Rationale:** Single-parent bottleneck was primary constraint; validate other mechanisms independently

**If C177 H1 = CONFIRMED:**
- **Action:** Test synergistic combinations (H1+H2, H1+H4, H1+H5)
- **Rationale:** Energy pooling helps but insufficient alone; combine with complementary mechanisms

**If C177 H1 = MARGINAL SUPPORT:**
- **Action:** Test H2 and H4 individually, then consider H2+H4
- **Rationale:** Single-parent bottleneck minor factor; prioritize recovery lag (H2) and death activity (H4)

**If C177 H1 = REJECTED:**
- **Action:** Test H2, H4, H5 individually
- **Rationale:** Single-parent bottleneck NOT limiting; focus on temporal asymmetries

## High-Priority Combinations

### 1. H1 + H2: Energy Pooling + External Sources

**Mechanistic Synergy:**
- **H1:** Distributes reproductive capacity across cluster members (addresses spatial bottleneck)
- **H2:** Accelerates individual recovery via task-based rewards (addresses temporal bottleneck)
- **Combined Effect:** Cooperative spawning + faster recovery → sustained multi-generational lineages

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- **Birth rate:** 5× improvement (0.005 → 0.025 agents/cycle)
  - H1 contribution: 3× (distributed capacity)
  - H2 contribution: 2× (faster recovery)
  - Multiplicative: 3× × 2× = 6× potential (capped by death rate)
- **Mean population:** 12-18 agents (vs 0.49 baseline)
- **Death-birth ratio:** Approaches 1.0 (balanced dynamics)

**Implementation:**
- Energy pooling: α=0.10 (10% sharing within clusters)
- External sources: Task completion rewards (E_reward=5.0 per successful composition cluster formation)
- Trigger: Agents gain energy when participating in resonance cluster detection

**Experimental Design:**
- **Conditions:** BASELINE / H1-only / H2-only / H1+H2
- **Parameters:** f=2.5%, n=10 seeds per condition, 3,000 cycles
- **Outcome:** Validate whether combined mechanisms achieve homeostasis

---

### 2. H1 + H4: Energy Pooling + Composition Throttling

**Mechanistic Synergy:**
- **H1:** Increases birth capacity through cooperative energy sharing
- **H4:** Decreases death rate through density-dependent throttling
- **Combined Effect:** Simultaneous birth enhancement + death reduction → balanced rates

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- **Birth rate:** 3× improvement from H1 (0.005 → 0.015 agents/cycle)
- **Death rate:** 50% reduction from H4 (0.013 → 0.0065 agents/cycle)
- **Net effect:** Birth exceeds death (0.015 > 0.0065), enabling population growth
- **Mean population:** 15-25 agents (sustained ceiling)

**Implementation:**
- Energy pooling: α=0.10 (10% sharing)
- Composition throttling: Probability P_comp = base × (1 - ρ/ρ_max)
  - ρ = current population density
  - ρ_max = 30 agents (maximum sustainable population)
  - Base composition rate: 0.013 agents/cycle
  - At ρ=15 (50% capacity): P_comp = 0.013 × 0.5 = 0.0065

**Experimental Design:**
- **Conditions:** BASELINE / H1-only / H4-only / H1+H4
- **Parameters:** f=2.5%, n=10 seeds per condition, 3,000 cycles
- **Validation:** Population ceiling emergence (equilibrium attractor)

---

### 3. H1 + H5: Energy Pooling + Multi-Generational Recovery

**Mechanistic Synergy:**
- **H1:** Distributes reproductive capacity spatially (across cluster members)
- **H5:** Distributes reproductive capacity temporally (staggered spawning across generations)
- **Combined Effect:** Asynchronous spawning from multiple lineages → continuous birth presence

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- **Birth rate:** 5-6× improvement (0.005 → 0.025-0.030 agents/cycle)
  - H1 contribution: 3× (cluster cooperation)
  - H5 contribution: 2× (generational overlap)
  - Combined: Multiple agents fertile simultaneously across generations
- **Mean population:** 18-30 agents
- **Death-birth ratio:** 0.5-0.7 (birth dominates)

**Implementation:**
- Energy pooling: α=0.10 (10% sharing)
- Multi-generational recovery:
  - Gen 0 (root): E₀=130, spawn every 320 cycles
  - Gen 1 (children): E₀=39, spawn every 1,000 cycles (if they recover via pooling)
  - Gen 2 (grandchildren): E₀=11.7, spawn if pooling boosts above threshold
- **Key:** Pooling enables Gen 1 to regain fertility before sterility, creating overlapping spawning windows

**Experimental Design:**
- **Conditions:** BASELINE / H1-only / H5-only / H1+H5
- **Parameters:** f=2.5%, n=10 seeds per condition, 3,000 cycles
- **Outcome:** Validate asynchronous multi-generational spawning

## Moderate-Priority Combinations

### 4. H2 + H4: External Sources + Composition Throttling

**Mechanistic Synergy:**
- **H2:** Faster recovery → higher birth rate
- **H4:** Density-dependent death → lower death rate at high populations
- **Combined Effect:** Accelerated birth + moderated death → homeostatic equilibrium

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- **Birth rate:** 2× improvement (0.005 → 0.010 agents/cycle)
- **Death rate:** Dynamic (0.013 → 0.004-0.013 depending on density)
- **Mean population:** 8-15 agents (equilibrium where birth ≈ death)

**Use Case:** If H1 rejected (single-parent bottleneck not limiting), H2+H4 addresses temporal and death activity asymmetries directly.

---

### 5. H2 + H5: External Sources + Multi-Generational Recovery

**Mechanistic Synergy:**
- Both address recovery lag through different mechanisms
- **H2:** External energy accelerates individual recovery
- **H5:** Multi-generational overlap reduces dependency on single lineage recovery
- **Combined Effect:** Redundant mechanisms ensure continuous birth capacity

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- **Birth rate:** 4× improvement (0.005 → 0.020 agents/cycle)
- **Mean population:** 10-18 agents
- **Robustness:** System resilient to individual lineage sterility

---

### 6. H4 + H5: Composition Throttling + Multi-Generational Recovery

**Mechanistic Synergy:**
- **H4:** Protects high-density populations from death
- **H5:** Maintains birth presence across generations
- **Combined Effect:** Stabilizing feedback (high pop → low death, continuous birth → sustained pop)

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- **Mean population:** 15-25 agents
- **Death-birth ratio:** Approaches 1.0 at equilibrium
- **Stability:** Low coefficient of variation (CV < 30%)

---

## Triple Combinations (If Necessary)

**H1 + H2 + H4:** Maximum intervention
- Cooperative birth + fast recovery + throttled death
- **Predicted:** Mean population 25-40 agents, strong homeostasis
- **Use Case:** If pairwise combinations show MARGINAL effects

**H1 + H4 + H5:** Spatial + temporal cooperation + death regulation
- Distributed capacity across members and generations + density control
- **Predicted:** Mean population 20-35 agents, robust to perturbations
- **Use Case:** If H2 (external sources) infeasible or rejected

---

## Experimental Parameters (All Combinations)

**Fixed Across Experiments:**
- Spawn frequency: f = 2.5%
- Seeds: n = 10 per condition
- Cycles: 3,000
- Energy recharge rate: r = 0.010
- Spawn threshold: E ≥ 10.0

**Condition Structure:**
- BASELINE (no interventions)
- Hypothesis A only
- Hypothesis B only
- Hypothesis A + B (combination)

**Statistical Analysis:**
- Factorial ANOVA (2×2 design): Main effects + interaction
- Post-hoc pairwise comparisons (Tukey HSD)
- Cohen's d effect sizes for all pairwise contrasts

---

## Success Criteria

**Synergistic Effect Confirmed:**
- Combination mean > sum of individual improvements (super-additive)
- Statistically significant interaction term (p < 0.05)
- Death-birth ratio approaches 1.0 (±0.2)
- Population stability: CV < 50%

**Homeostasis Achieved:**
- Mean population sustained >10 agents across all seeds
- Zero extinctions (final count > 0 for all seeds)
- Birth rate ≈ death rate (ratio 0.8-1.2)

**Publication Value:**
- Validates synergistic emergence (systems-level effects > component sum)
- Demonstrates architectural requirements for sustained populations
- Provides concrete roadmap for future fractal agent frameworks

---

## Timeline Estimates

**Per Combination Experiment:**
- Implementation: 1 cycle (~30 min) per new mechanism
- Validation: 1 cycle (baseline replication)
- Execution: 1 cycle (~30 min for 40 experiments if parallelized, ~2 hours if serial)
- Analysis: 1 cycle (~30 min)

**Total for High-Priority Combinations (H1+H2, H1+H4, H1+H5):**
- Serial execution: ~9 cycles (~4.5 hours)
- Parallel execution (if resources allow): ~4 cycles (~2 hours)

## Integration into Paper 2

**If Synergistic Effects Found:**
- Add Section 3.7: "Synergistic Hypothesis Combinations"
- Update Discussion 4.6 with empirical validation
- Revise Conclusions to emphasize systems-level emergence

**If No Synergistic Effects:**
- Brief mention in Discussion 4.5 (Future Directions)
- Emphasize need for architectural changes beyond parameter tuning

---

## Contingency Planning

**If All Combinations Fail:**
- **Interpretation:** Death-birth imbalance stems from fundamental architectural constraints (discrete spawning events vs continuous death detection)
- **Alternative Approaches:**
  1. Continuous birth process (probabilistic spawning every cycle)
  2. Batched death detection (composition checks every N cycles)
  3. Energy-dependent mortality (low-energy agents more vulnerable)
  4. Reproduction via fusion (two agents merge to create child)

**If Success Requires Triple Combinations:**
- **Interpretation:** Homeostasis requires simultaneous intervention across all three asymmetries
- **Implication:** Robust self-organizing systems need comprehensive architectural support
