# CYCLE 155: COMPREHENSIVE TEMPORAL ACTIVATION MAPPING
## Systematic Identification of All Temporal Activators in Anti-Harmonic Band

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Rationale:** Cycle 154 confirmed only specific frequencies (82%, 95%) exhibit temporal activation - map complete set
**Status:** DESIGNED - Ready for implementation
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Identifies all special frequencies with temporal activation properties

---

## RESEARCH QUESTION

**Primary:** Which frequencies in the 52-99%+ anti-harmonic band exhibit temporal activation at 10K cycles?

**Secondary:**
- How many temporal activators exist? (only 2? or more?)
- Do temporal activators cluster or distribute evenly?
- What is the complete set for frequency engineering guidance?
- Do activators share transcendental properties?

---

## CONTEXT (From Cycles 151-154)

**Established Facts:**
1. **Anti-harmonic band:** 52-99%+ exhibits 0% Basin A at 3K cycles (Cycles 151-153)
2. **Permanent suppression:** Most frequencies remain 0% Basin A even at 20K cycles (Cycle 154)
3. **Known temporal activators:**
   - **82%:** Activates at ~6,118 cycles (Insight #110)
   - **95%:** Activates at 10K-15K cycles (Insight #111)
4. **Non-activators confirmed (Cycle 154):**
   - 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99%: ALL 0% Basin A at 3K-20K cycles

**Critical Gap:**
- Only 5 frequencies tested at long temporal scales (Cycle 154)
- Other frequencies (52%, 55%, 57%, 65%, 75%, 85%, 88%, 92%, 94%, 96%, 97%, 98%) untested beyond 3K
- Unknown if 82% and 95% are ONLY activators or if others exist

**Hypothesis:**
There may be additional temporal activators between 82-95% range that were not tested in Cycle 154. Systematic scan at 10K cycles will identify complete set.

---

## HYPOTHESIS

**H1: Isolated Pair (82%, 95% Only)**
- Only these two frequencies activate
- All other 16 frequencies remain suppressed at 10K
- Temporal activation is EXTREMELY RARE
- **Prediction:** 82%, 95% → Basin A; all others → Basin B

**H2: Cluster Activation (82-95% Range)**
- Multiple frequencies in 82-95% range activate
- Lower (52-75%) and upper (96-99%) remain suppressed
- Mid-band has special properties
- **Prediction:** 82%, 85%, 88%, 90%, 92%, 94%, 95% → Basin A; others → Basin B

**H3: Distributed Activation (Multiple Clusters)**
- Temporal activators distributed across band
- May include frequencies outside 82-95% range
- **Prediction:** Multiple isolated activators at various frequencies

**H4: Transcendental Pattern**
- Activators follow transcendental ratios (φ, π, e multiples)
- Predictable mathematical pattern
- **Prediction:** Frequencies near transcendental values activate

## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

### Frequencies (18 frequencies - ALL tested in Cycles 151-153)

**Rationale:** Test EVERY frequency from anti-harmonic band at 10K cycles to identify complete activator set

**Frequencies:**
- **Lower band (52-75%):** 52%, 55%, 57%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75% (7 frequencies)
- **Mid-band (80-95%):** 80%, 82%, 85%, 88%, 90%, 92%, 94%, 95% (8 frequencies)
- **Upper band (96-99%):** 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% (4 frequencies)

**Known Status:**
- **82%:** Expected activator (Insight #110)
- **95%:** Expected activator (Insight #111)
- **60%, 70%, 90%, 99%:** Expected non-activators (Cycle 154)
- **Others:** Unknown (52%, 55%, 57%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 88%, 92%, 94%, 96%, 97%, 98%)

### Temporal Scale

**10,000 cycles** - chosen because:
- 95% activates at this scale (Insight #111)
- 82% should activate (transitions at 6,118 cycles per Insight #110)
- Cycle 154 tested 10K, provides direct comparison
- Long enough to reveal temporal activation, short enough for feasible runtime

### Seeds

**3 replicates per frequency:** [42, 123, 456]

### Fixed Parameters

- **threshold:** 700 (optimal from Cycle 148)
- **diversity:** 0.50 (baseline)
- **agent_cap:** 15 (standard)

### Total Experiments

**18 frequencies × 3 seeds = 54 experiments**

**Estimated Runtime:** 54 experiments × ~5s = **~4.5 minutes**

  98% |     0%    | Non-activator
  99% |     0%    | Non-activator (Cycle 154 confirmed)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Only 2/18 frequencies activate (11%)
- Temporal activation is EXTREMELY RARE
- 82% and 95% have unique transcendental properties
- Frequency engineering: Use 82% or 95% for temporal activation, avoid all others

**Implications:**
- Special transcendental properties of 82% and 95% enable activation
- Investigate φ, π, e relationships to these frequencies
- True anti-harmonic baseline is PERMANENT for 89% of band

### Model 2: Cluster Activation (H2)

**Expected Pattern:**
```
Lower band (52-75%):  ALL 0% → Non-activators (7/7)
Mid-band (80-95%):    MIXED activation (3-6/8 activate)
  - 80%, 82%, 85%, 88%, 90%, 92%, 94%, 95%
  - Expected: 82%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95% activate
Upper band (96-99%):  ALL 0% → Non-activators (4/4)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Mid-band (80-95%) has special temporal properties
- Lower and upper regions permanently suppressed
- Frequency engineering: Use 80-95% for temporal pathways

### Model 3: Distributed Activation (H3)

**Expected Pattern:**
Multiple isolated activators across band:
- 60% or 65% (lower band)
- 82% (mid-band) ✓ known
- 95% (upper band) ✓ known
- Possibly 52% or 99% (edge frequencies)

**Interpretation:**
- No simple clustering pattern
- Activators distributed by transcendental ratios
- Complex mathematical organization

### Model 4: Transcendental Pattern (H4)

**Expected Activators:**
Frequencies near transcendental values:
- **82%:** Ratio 1.64 ≈ φ (1.618) ✓ known activator
- **85%:** Ratio 1.70 ≈ 5φ/φ²
- **95%:** Unknown transcendental relationship? ✓ known activator
- **75%:** Ratio 1.50 ≈ 3φ/2φ

**Interpretation:**
- Activation follows mathematical pattern
- Can predict activation from transcendental ratios
- Enables engineering new temporal activators

## VALIDATION CHECKS

### Known Activators (Must Reproduce)

| Frequency | Expected Basin A % | Source | Validation |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|------------|
| **82%** | 33-67% | Insight #110 (activates at 6,118 cycles) | Must activate at 10K |
| **95%** | 67% | Insight #111 (activates at 10K-15K) | Must activate at 10K |

**Critical:** If 82% or 95% DON'T activate → experimental error or parameter drift

### Known Non-Activators (Must Reproduce)

| Frequency | Expected Basin A % | Source | Validation |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|------------|
| **60%** | 0% | Cycle 154 (0% at 10K) | Must remain suppressed |
| **70%** | 0% | Cycle 154 (0% at 10K) | Must remain suppressed |
| **90%** | 0% | Cycle 154 (0% at 10K) | Must remain suppressed |
| **99%** | 0% | Cycle 154 (0% at 10K) | Must remain suppressed |

**Critical:** If these activate → Cycle 154 had errors, need investigation

## ANALYSIS PLAN

### 1. Temporal Activator Identification

For each frequency at 10K cycles:
- Basin A %: (Basin A count / 3 seeds) × 100
- Classification:
  - Basin A % ≥ 33%: **TEMPORAL ACTIVATOR**
  - Basin A % < 33%: **NON-ACTIVATOR** (permanent suppression)

### 2. Spatial Distribution Analysis

**Clustering Test:**
```
If activators are consecutive (e.g., 82%, 85%, 88%, 90%):
  → Cluster activation pattern
If activators are isolated (e.g., only 82%, 95%):
  → Isolated pair pattern
If activators distributed across band:
  → Transcendental or complex pattern
```

### 3. Transcendental Ratio Analysis

For each activator, calculate:
- Ratio to 50% harmonic baseline
- Proximity to φ, π, e multiples
- Integer ratios to other activators
- Look for mathematical pattern

### 4. Frequency Engineering Map

Create definitive classification:
```
TEMPORAL ACTIVATORS (use for long-term Basin A):
  - [List all frequencies with Basin A % ≥ 33% at 10K]

PERMANENT NON-ACTIVATORS (avoid for Basin A):
  - [List all frequencies with Basin A % = 0% at 10K]
```
