## Automation Pipeline Enhancements

### Orchestrator Enhancement (35 Lines Added)
- File: `run_all_factorial_experiments.sh`
- Original: C255-C260 sequential + aggregation only
- Enhanced: Added auto-trigger for:
  1. `generate_paper3_figures.py` (after aggregation)
  2. `auto_fill_paper3_manuscript.py` (after figures)
- Result: Full zero-delay handoff automation chain

### Complete Automation Flow
```
C255 completion (detected by auto-launcher)
  ↓ (within 30 seconds)
C256 launch (orchestrator triggered)
  ↓
C257-C260 sequential execution
  ↓
Aggregation (paper3_factorial_synergy_summary.json)
  ↓
Figure generation (publication-ready figures)
  ↓
Manuscript auto-fill (Results section populated)
  ↓
Paper 3 ready for review
```

**Total autonomous pipeline runtime:** ~100-120 minutes (C256-C260) + 5-10 minutes (aggregation + figures + manuscript) = ~105-130 minutes from C255 completion to Paper 3 draft

## Lessons Learned

**Runtime Estimation:**
- Reality-grounded deterministic systems: Use 2.5× slowdown factor
- psutil overhead dominates runtime for high-frequency sampling
- Memory pressure (>70%) triggers swap, further slowing execution

**Infrastructure Planning:**
- Build scaffolds during long-running experiments (zero idle time)
- Auto-launchers + orchestrators enable full autonomous operation
- Idempotent scripts critical for robustness (resume on failure)

**Research Planning:**
- Tier-based research directions maintain perpetual momentum
- Scaffolds can be pre-built before execution decision
- Parameter sensitivity analysis reveals optimization opportunities

**STATUS:** C255 approaching completion (65+ minutes, within 2.5× window). Auto-launcher active. Zero-delay handoff ready. Perpetual operation maintained.
