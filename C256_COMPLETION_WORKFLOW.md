# C256 COMPLETION WORKFLOW

**Purpose:** Systematic workflow for processing C256 (H1Ã—H4 factorial) results upon completion

**Estimated Time:** ~22 minutes

**Trigger:** C256 experiment completes (process PID 31144 exits, results file created)

---

## 1. Result Validation (2 min)

**Verify experiment completed successfully:**

```bash
# Check process no longer running
ps aux | grep 31144 | grep -v grep  # Should return empty

# Check results file exists
ls -lh /Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments/results/cycle256_h1h4_optimized_results.json

# Check file size (should be ~50-100 KB)
wc -l /Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments/results/cycle256_h1h4_optimized_results.json
```

**Expected outcome:**
- âœ… Process terminated cleanly (exit code 0)
- âœ… Results file exists and is non-empty
- âœ… JSON is valid (can be parsed)

**If validation fails:**
- Check log file: `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments/logs/cycle256_mechanism_validation.log`
- Review error messages
- Determine if re-run needed

---

## 2. Data Extraction (3 min)

**Extract key metrics from results JSON:**

```bash
# View results summary
python3 << 'EOF'
import json
from pathlib import Path

results_file = Path("/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments/results/cycle256_h1h4_optimized_results.json")
with open(results_file, 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Extract synergy analysis
synergy = data['synergy_analysis']

print("=== C256 H1Ã—H4 RESULTS ===")
print(f"OFF-OFF: {synergy['off_off']:.4f}")
print(f"ON-OFF (H1 only): {synergy['on_off']:.4f}")
print(f"OFF-ON (H4 only): {synergy['off_on']:.4f}")
print(f"ON-ON (H1Ã—H4): {synergy['on_on']:.4f}")
print()
print(f"H1 effect: {synergy['h1_effect']:+.4f}")
print(f"H4 effect: {synergy['h4_effect']:+.4f}")
print(f"Additive prediction: {synergy['additive_prediction']:.4f}")
print(f"Synergy: {synergy['synergy']:+.4f}")
print(f"Fold-change: {synergy['fold_change']:.2f}Ã—")
print()
print(f"Classification: {synergy['classification']}")
print(f"Interpretation: {synergy['interpretation']}")
EOF
```

**Expected output format:**
```
OFF-OFF: 0.0700
ON-OFF (H1 only): 0.9500
OFF-ON (H4 only): 0.0500
ON-ON (H1Ã—H4): 0.4500

H1 effect: +0.8800
H4 effect: -0.0200
Additive prediction: 0.9300
Synergy: -0.4800
Fold-change: 6.43Ã—

Classification: ANTAGONISTIC
Interpretation: Energy pooling and spawn throttling interfere with each other
```

## 3. Manuscript Integration (8 min)

**File:** `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/papers/paper3_mechanism_synergies_template.md`

**Section to update:** Line 293-296 (3.2 Experiment 2: H1Ã—H4)

**Replace:**
```markdown
### 3.2 Experiment 2: H1Ã—H4 (Energy Pooling Ã— Spawn Throttling)

[TO BE FILLED - Same structure as 3.1]
```

**With:**
```markdown
### 3.2 Experiment 2: H1Ã—H4 (Energy Pooling Ã— Spawn Throttling)

**Condition Results:**
- OFF-OFF: [VALUE] mean population
- H1-only: [VALUE] mean population
- H4-only: [VALUE] mean population
- H1Ã—H4: [VALUE] mean population

**Effect Sizes:**
- H1 effect: [VALUE]
- H4 effect: [VALUE]
- Predicted combined: [VALUE]
- Observed combined: [VALUE]
- **Synergy: [VALUE]**

**Classification:** [SYNERGISTIC / ANTAGONISTIC / ADDITIVE]

**Interpretation:** [Describe the observed interaction pattern. If ANTAGONISTIC: explain how throttling constrains pooling benefits. If SYNERGISTIC: explain amplification. If ADDITIVE: explain independence.]

**Hypothesis Validation:** [CONFIRMED / REJECTED] - Predicted ANTAGONISTIC, observed [CLASSIFICATION]
```

**Update synergy matrix table (line 330):**

Before:
```
| H1Ã—H4 | [TO BE FILLED] | [TO BE FILLED] | ANTAGONISTIC |
```

After:
```
| H1Ã—H4 | [SYNERGY_VALUE] | [CLASSIFICATION] | ANTAGONISTIC |
```

## 4. Workspace Sync (3 min)

**Sync updated manuscript to git repository:**

```bash
# Copy updated manuscript from V2 to git
cp /Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/papers/paper3_mechanism_synergies_template.md \
   /Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/papers/

# Copy C256 results file to git
cp /Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments/results/cycle256_h1h4_optimized_results.json \
   /Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive/data/results/
```

---

## 5. Git Commit (3 min)

```bash
cd /Users/aldrinpayopay/nested-resonance-memory-archive

# Stage files
git add papers/paper3_mechanism_synergies_template.md
git add data/results/cycle256_h1h4_optimized_results.json

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

**Cycles:** 3000 per condition (4 conditions, deterministic n=1)

Results Summary:
- OFF-OFF: [VALUE] mean population (baseline)
- ON-OFF (H1 only): [VALUE] mean population

- H4 effect: [VALUE]
- Synergy: [VALUE]
- Classification: [CLASSIFICATION]

Hypothesis: Predicted ANTAGONISTIC (throttling constrains pooling)
Outcome: [CONFIRMED / REJECTED]

Paper 3 Integration:
- Updated section 3.2 with experimental results
- Updated synergy matrix (H1Ã—H4 row)
- 1/6 pairwise interactions complete

Next Steps:
- Launch C257-C260 batch (~47 min) to complete remaining 4 pairs
- Final pair will complete Paper 3 experimental coverage (6/6)

## 6. Launch C257-C260 Batch (3 min)

**After C256 integration complete, launch remaining 4 experiments:**

```bash
cd /Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments

# Make batch script executable
chmod +x run_c257_c260_batch.sh

# Launch batch (optimized versions, ~47 min total)
./run_c257_c260_batch.sh

# Monitor first experiment launch
tail -f logs/cycle257_execution.log
```

**Batch contains:**
1. C257: H1Ã—H5 (Energy Pooling Ã— Energy Recovery) - ~11 min
2. C258: H2Ã—H4 (Reality Sources Ã— Spawn Throttling) - ~12 min
3. C259: H2Ã—H5 (Reality Sources Ã— Energy Recovery) - ~13 min
4. C260: H4Ã—H5 (Spawn Throttling Ã— Energy Recovery) - ~11 min

**Expected outcome:**
- âœ… All 4 experiments execute sequentially
- âœ… Results files created in `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments/results/`
- âœ… Logs created in `/Volumes/dual/DUALITY-ZERO-V2/experiments/logs/`
- âœ… ~47 minutes total runtime
- âœ… Paper 3 experimental coverage: 5/6 complete

## 7. Post-Batch Workflow

**When C257-C260 batch completes (~47 min later):**

1. **Validate all 4 experiments completed successfully**
2. **Extract results from all 4 JSON files**
3. **Integrate into Paper 3 sections 3.3-3.6**
4. **Update synergy matrix with remaining 4 rows**
5. **Analyze overall synergy landscape:**
   - How many hypotheses validated?
   - Patterns across mechanism pairs?
   - Implications for NRM framework?
6. **Update Paper 3 Abstract, Conclusions, Discussion**
7. **Sync and commit to git**
8. **Generate Paper 3 figures** (synergy matrix heatmap, condition comparisons)
9. **Update META_OBJECTIVES.md** with Paper 3 status

## Checklist

Before executing this workflow, ensure:

- [ ] C256 process (PID 31144) has terminated
- [ ] Results file exists and is non-empty
- [ ] JSON is valid and parseable
- [ ] Paper 3 template is current (synced in Cycle 615)
- [ ] Git repository is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Batch script is executable and uses optimized versions
- [ ] All 5 optimized scripts have cached_metrics bug fixed (Cycle 616)

---

## Automation Note

This workflow is designed for systematic execution. Future optimization: Create Python script to automate steps 2-5 (data extraction â†’ manuscript integration â†’ git commit).

For now, execute manually to ensure quality control and proper validation at each step.
