DecompositionEngine - Burst Dynamics and Cluster Dissolution

Implements decomposition dynamics where fractal clusters burst into constituent agents.
Decomposition occurs when clusters reach critical energy thresholds or instability conditions,
releasing child agents back to depth-1 level.

Theoretical Basis:
    - Decomposition: Burst dissolution of clusters
    - Energy Threshold: Critical low energy triggers decomposition
    - Constituent Release: Child agents return to independent state
    - Memory Transfer: Cluster patterns distributed to constituents
    - Depth Reduction: Agents return to original depth

Reality Grounding:
    - All operations on internal Python objects (no external services)
    - Measurable decomposition criteria
    - Verifiable energy conservation (total energy preserved)
    - Timestamp tracking for burst events

    Decomposition Process:
        1. Detect critical conditions (low energy, instability)

        4. Transfer cluster memory to constituents
        5. Distribute residual cluster energy
        6. Break parent-child relationships

        - Has children: Cluster must have constituent agents
        - Sufficient depth: Cluster at depth ≥ 1 (not base agents)
