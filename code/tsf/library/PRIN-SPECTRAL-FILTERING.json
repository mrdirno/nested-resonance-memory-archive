    "description": "The Swarm acts as a bank of coupled oscillators that can selectively resonate with a target frequency embedded in high-amplitude noise, effectively filtering the signal. This mechanism provides a physical basis for 'Attention' in the Pilot.",
    "hypothesis": "If agents are tuned to a target frequency and coupled to a noisy signal via Phase Response Curve (PRC) injection, they will phase-lock to the signal component and reject uncorrelated noise, increasing SNR.",

        "input_snr": "-8.39 dB",

        "The Pilot can 'attend' to specific reality signals by tuning the swarm's natural frequency.",
        "Noise tolerance is an emergent property of collective resonance.",
        "Provides a mechanism for 'Cognitive Filtering' without digital logic."
