    "description": "The ability of the swarm to minimize 'Surprise' (Prediction Error) by maintaining and updating an internal model of the environment, rather than just reacting to it.",
    "hypothesis": "Internal Model + Error Correction -> Free Energy Minimization",
    "findings": [
        "Implemented a Bayesian Agent (Kalman Filter) vs. a Reactive Agent.",
        "The Bayesian Agent achieved 65.27% lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) in tracking a noisy moving target.",
        "This confirms that maintaining an internal model allows the system to filter noise and predict future states, effectively minimizing thermodynamic Free Energy.",
        "Model mismatch (e.g., Linear Model vs. Circular Path) significantly increases Free Energy, highlighting the need for model adaptation."

    "implications": [
        "Swarms must be predictive, not just reactive.",
        "Minimizing prediction error is equivalent to maximizing survival probability.",
        "The brain is a statistical inference engine."
