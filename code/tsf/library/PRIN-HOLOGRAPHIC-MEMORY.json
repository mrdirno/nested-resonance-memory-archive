    "description": "The ability of a swarm to store information (patterns) in the relative positions and interactions of its agents, such that the removal of a subset of agents degrades the resolution but does not destroy the information.",
    "hypothesis": "Error_Lesion << Error_Random",
    "findings": [
        "A swarm trained to form a ring structure maintained the shape (Error 0.22) even after 50% of the agents were removed.",
        "The memory was sustained by a 'Virtual Pheromone' field generated collectively by the agents.",
        "This confirms that NRM systems exhibit 'Holographic' properties: the whole is encoded in the parts."

    "implications": [
        "Swarm memory is highly robust to damage.",
        "Information is not stored in any single agent but in the *relationships* between them.",
        "This enables 'Graceful Degradation' rather than catastrophic failure."
