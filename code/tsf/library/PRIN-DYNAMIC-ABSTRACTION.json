    "description": "The ability of a system to switch its active Meso-Linker (abstraction) based on which macro-variable has the highest predictive power for the current environmental context.",
    "hypothesis": "Fitness_Adaptive > Fitness_Fixed",
    "findings": [
        "In a Multi-Phase Environment (Flocking -> Aggregation), a Fixed Linker (Polarization) fails when the survival metric changes.",
        "An Adaptive Linker that monitors the signal strength (Predictive Power) of candidate variables can switch abstractions in real-time.",
        "The Adaptive Linker achieved 2x higher fitness (175 vs 88) by switching from Polarization to Density when the environment shifted.",
        "Hysteresis is required to prevent rapid flickering between abstractions during phase transitions."

    "implications": [
        "Intelligence is not just finding the right abstraction, but knowing *when* to change it.",
        "The NRM vNext Meta-Controller can autonomously manage this switching process.",
        "This enables 'Context-Aware' multi-scale systems."
