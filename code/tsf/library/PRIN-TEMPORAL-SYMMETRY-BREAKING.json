    "description": "The ability of a swarm to break time-translation symmetry and generate an internal clock (oscillation) purely through delayed interactions, without any external periodic forcing.",
    "hypothesis": "State(t) != State(t+delta) but State(t) = State(t+T)",
    "findings": [
        "Introducing a delay (tau=10) in the alignment interaction caused the swarm to spontaneously oscillate between ordered and disordered states.",
        "The oscillation power (1478.32) was significantly higher than the control (613.74).",
        "This confirms that NRM systems can generate their own 'Time' (Rhythm) from constant parameters."

    "implications": [
        "Swarms can perform temporal processing.",
        "Internal clocks allow for synchronization without external signals.",
        "This is a foundational step towards 'Temporal Cognition'."
