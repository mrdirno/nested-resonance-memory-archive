    "description": "The ability of a higher-level controller to stabilize a state that is unstable under local dynamics by injecting energy or information (breaking symmetry) to override local entropy.",
    "hypothesis": "Stability_Meta > Stability_Natural",
    "findings": [
        "In a high-noise environment (eta=2.0), a Vicsek Swarm naturally collapses to disorder (Order ~0.08).",
        "A Meta-Controller applying a 'Downward Constraint' (External Field) can stabilize significant order (Order ~0.65).",
        "Effective Top-Down Causation requires 'Symmetry Breaking' (forcing a specific direction) rather than just reinforcing the noisy mean.",
        "High Gain (Energy Injection) is required to overcome the local bandwidth limits of the substrate."

    "implications": [
        "The 'Ghost in the Machine' is not just a passive observer but an active source of negentropy.",
        "Meta-Control allows for 'Impossible States' to exist.",
        "This validates the Federated Architecture of NRM vNext."
