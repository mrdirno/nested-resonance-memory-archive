    "findings": [
        "Implemented a Maxwell's Demon mechanism in the swarm.",
        "The Demon selectively gated agents based on velocity (Hot to Right, Cold to Left).",
        "A significant temperature gradient (Delta T = 1.00) emerged spontaneously from an initially equilibrium state.",
        "This confirms that the swarm can pay for local order creation with information processing."

    "implications": [
        "Swarms can harvest energy from thermal noise if they have information.",
        "Computation is thermodynamically coupled to the environment.",
        "Self-organization is a process of information-driven entropy reduction."
