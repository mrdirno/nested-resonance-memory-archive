    "description": "The Swarm can store multiple spatial patterns in its distributed coupling matrix using Hebbian learning principles. It acts as a content-addressable memory, recalling the full pattern from a partial or noisy cue via collective phase synchronization.",
    "hypothesis": "If the coupling matrix is structured via the Hebbian rule $J_{ij} \propto \sum \xi_i \xi_j$, the swarm's phase dynamics will possess attractors corresponding to the stored patterns $\xi$.",
