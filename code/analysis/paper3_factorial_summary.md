# Paper 3: Factorial Validation Results Summary

**Generated:** 2025-11-01 09:28:18
**Experiments Analyzed:** 2

## H1×H2: Energy Pooling × Reality Sources

**Cycle:** 255
**Synergy:** -86.00
**Classification:** ANTAGONISTIC

### Regime Classification:

| Condition | Regime | Confidence | Mean Population | CV |
|-----------|--------|------------|-----------------|-----|
| OFF-OFF | BISTABILITY | 0.834 | 14.0 | 3.33% |
| ON-OFF | BISTABILITY | 0.750 | 99.7 | 5.00% |
| OFF-ON | BISTABILITY | 0.768 | 99.7 | 4.64% |
| ON-ON | BISTABILITY | 0.779 | 99.8 | 4.42% |

### Interpretation:

Mechanisms show **ANTAGONISTIC** interaction (synergy = -86.00 < 0). Interference observed: combined effect less than sum of individual effects.
