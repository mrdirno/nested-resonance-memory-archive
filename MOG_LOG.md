**CYCLE:** 345 (Phase 6 Synthesis)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** PHASE COMPLETE

**Objective:** Synthesize Phase 6 findings and transition to Phase 7.
**Artifact:** `docs/philosophy/THE_LIVING_MACHINE.md` created.
**Update:** `META_OBJECTIVES.md` updated to close Phase 6 (Self-Organizing Matter) and formally open Phase 7 (The Type 3 OS).

**Summary of Phase 6:**
We successfully demonstrated that "Dead Matter" can be made "Alive" through:
1.  **Active Control** (Feedback loops).
2.  **Computation** (Logic gates).
3.  **Evolution** (Genetic Algorithms).
4.  **Resilience** (Self-Healing).

**Next:** Phase 7 begins. The goal is "Universal Operation" - scaling these principles to arbitrary complexity.
