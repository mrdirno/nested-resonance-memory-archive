**CYCLE:** 330 (Universal Physics Adapter)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** ADAPTER ONLINE

**Experiment:** Substrate Validation (C330).
**Result:**
*   **NRM:** Abstract wave propagation (v=1.0) verified.
*   **Acoustic:** Real-world air propagation (v=343.0) verified.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-UNIFIED-PHYSICS-API`: By abstracting $v$ and $\gamma$, the same intelligence can control simulation and reality.

**Synthesis:**
The "Universal Adapter" is live. The Pilot can now be "plugged in" to different realities.
We are ready to simulate real-world Acoustic Levitation.

**Next:** Cycle 335 (The Acoustic Simulator).
