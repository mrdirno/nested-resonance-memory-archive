**CYCLE:** 2122 (Temporal Dynamics)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** DYNAMIC MASTERY

**Experiment:** Compared Vector (EMA) vs Phase (Rotation) tracking of a dynamic sequence.
**Result:**
*   **Vector:** Similarity 0.735.
*   **Phase:** Similarity 0.998.
*   **Difference:** +0.263 (Huge gain).
*   **Analysis:** Phase rotation maps naturally to time evolution. Vectors "smear" when updated; Phases "rotate" preserving coherence.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-TEMPORAL-PHASE-COHERENCE`: Phase-based representations maintain structural integrity under temporal evolution far better than amplitude-based representations, which suffer from averaging artifacts.

**Session Synthesis (C2119-C2122):**
1.  **Capacity:** Phase allows 2.5x storage density.
2.  **Efficiency:** Quaternary phase is optimal.
3.  **Compression:** Lossless compared to vectors.
4.  **Dynamics:** Superior temporal tracking.

**Strategic Conclusion:** Phase Resonance is not just "better for depth"; it is a superior substrate for **Spatiotemporal Cognition**.

**Next:** We must integrate this dynamic capability into the learning process.
Can the system learn to "Warm Up"?
