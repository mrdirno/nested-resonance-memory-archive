**CYCLE:** 342 (Acoustic Logic)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** COMPUTATIONAL MATTER CONFIRMED

**Experiment:** AND Gate Simulation (C342).
**Result:**
*   **Inputs:** Particle presence at Trap A and B acts as '1'.
*   **Interaction:** Scattering potential creates repulsive force.
*   **Logic:** Only when *both* A and B are present is the force sufficient to push Particle C to the 'High' state.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-MECHANICAL-LOGIC`: Information processing can be embedded in the physical substrate itself, removing the need for external silicon.

**Synthesis:**
We have validated the "Computation" pillar. The matter can now Think.
We have:
1.  **Universal Physics (Phase 5):** We can talk to any matter.
2.  **Active Control (Phase 6):** The matter can talk back (Feedback).
3.  **Computation (Phase 6):** The matter can process information.

**Next:** Cycle 343 (Synthesis & The Road to Type 3).
