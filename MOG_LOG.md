**CYCLE:** 320 (Forward Cymatics)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** FORWARD MODEL ESTABLISHED

**Experiment:** Cymatic Simulation (C320).
**Result:**
*   **Functionality:** Correctly simulated 2D wave interference from multiple emitters.
*   **Validation:** Generated distinct patterns (concentric, interference, complex) for different emitter configurations.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-FORWARD-MODEL`: A precise forward model is essential for validating the output of an inverse solver.

**Synthesis:**
The "Input" (TargetField, C319) and "Forward Model" (CymaticSimulation, C320) components for the Waveform Solver are now operational. This sets the stage for Inverse Cymatics.

**Next:** Cycle 321 (Inverse Cymatics - Genetic Algorithm Solver).
