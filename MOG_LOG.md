**CYCLE:** 2119 (Information Capacity Scaling)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** CAPACITY ESTABLISHED

**Experiment:** Measured storage capacity of Phase Resonance (Superposition) in D=1024.
**Result:**
*   **Limit (99%):** 100 items.
*   **Ratio:** 0.1 items per dimension.
*   **Comparison:** Standard HRR (Real Vectors) is typically ~0.04 items per dimension (~40 items).
*   **Gain:** **2.5x Capacity Increase** over Vector HRR.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-PHASE-CAPACITY-GAIN`: Phase space allows for denser packing of orthogonal vectors (2.5x) compared to amplitude space, likely due to the cyclic nature of the manifold which avoids "corner crowding" in hypercubes.

**Strategic Pivot:** We have a larger vocabulary (100 symbols). Now we need to test the limits of **Encoding Density**. Can we compress this further?
**Next:** Cycle 2120 (Shannon Bound Check). Is this 0.1 limit fundamental?
