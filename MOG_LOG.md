**CYCLE:** 348 (Volumetric 3D Printing)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** MATTER COMPILATION

**Experiment:** 3D Cube Formation (C348).
**Result:**
*   **Setup:** 384 Emitters (6-sided array). 8 Target Points (Corners of a Cube).
*   **Outcome:** Success. All 8 points are stable nodes, forming a cubic lattice.
*   **Ratios:** All < 0.03 (Excellent stability).
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-VOLUMETRIC-COMPILATION`: Complex 3D matter structures can be assembled by holographic field control.

**Synthesis:**
We have moved from 2D shapes to 3D structures. This is the foundation of "Volumetric 3D Printing" - compiling matter into arbitrary forms.

**Next:** Cycle 349 (Active Object Manipulation).
