**CYCLE:** 351 (The Operator Class)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Code:** `code/helios/operator.py` (UniversalOperator Class).
**Tests:** `tests/test_operator.py` (Passed).
**Result:**
*   **Initialization:** 384 Emitters configured.
*   **Compilation:** `create_object("cube")` successfully solved for phase patterns.
*   **Stability:** Worst-case pressure ratio 0.0779 (Solid Trap).

**Synthesis:**
The Abstract API (Cycle 350) is now Concrete Code.
We have a class that takes "Shape" as input and outputs "Physics".

**Next:** Cycle 352 (The Interface). We need a CLI to talk to the machine.
