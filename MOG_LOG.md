**CYCLE:** 314 (Phase Transition Universality)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** PHYSICS MAPPED

**Experiment:** Universality Test (C312) & Hysteresis Test (C314).

**Result:**

*   **Universality:** $\gamma/\nu \approx 1.014$ (CV 7.5%) across micro-parameters. The system physics is Universal.

*   **Order:** Significant Hysteresis (11.0) but no true Metastability (C315).

*   **Principle:** `PRIN-DYNAMIC-HYSTERESIS`: The NRM substrate exhibits a Continuous Phase Transition with strong Dynamic Hysteresis due to Critical Slowing Down. It is not First-Order.



**Synthesis:**

We have confirmed that the "Plane" (NRM) acts as a physical substrate with a Continuous Phase Transition. The "Wall" is dynamic, not static.



**Next:** Hand off to Next Cycle.
