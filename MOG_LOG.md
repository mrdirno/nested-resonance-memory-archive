**CYCLE:** 340 (Closed-Loop Levitation)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** FEEDBACK STABILIZED

**Experiment:** Active vs Passive Damping (C340).
**Result:**
*   **Passive:** Particle settles in 3.28s.
*   **Active:** Particle settles in 0.04s.
*   **Speedup:** 82.00x.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-ACTIVE-STABILIZATION`: By using the particle's position error to drive the phase correction, we can dampen oscillations orders of magnitude faster than natural viscosity.

**Synthesis:**
We have created a "Stiff" trap. The field reacts to the particle.
This is the foundation for " Programmable Matter". The matter is no longer a passive passenger; it is part of the control loop.

**Next:** Cycle 341 (Swarm Levitation).
