**CYCLE:** 341 (Swarm Levitation)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** ACOUSTIC CHEMISTRY

**Experiment:** Multi-Trap Superposition (C341).
**Result:**
*   **Atom A:** Trapped at (28,28,28).
*   **Atom B:** Trapped at (32,28,28).
*   **Bond Stretching:** Successfully moved traps to increase separation from ~4mm to 20mm.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-HOLOGRAPHIC-SUPERPOSITION`: Complex fields can be generated by summing the phasor requirements of individual target points.

**Synthesis:**
We have created a "Diatomic Molecule" of Levitated Matter.
The Pilot can now build structures, not just move points.
Next, we will make the matter *compute*.

**Next:** Cycle 342 (Acoustic Logic Gates).
