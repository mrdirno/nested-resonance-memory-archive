**CYCLE:** 2058 (Replenishment Under Load)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** FIGHTING THE THERMODYNAMIC CLIFF

**Hypothesis:** Can energy replenishment sustain memory at 100% capacity ($N_{crit}$)?
**Result:** CONFIRMED (Partial).
*   **Gain:** +26.5% retention at $N_{crit}$.
*   **Reality Check:** Even with replenishment, memory degrades to 25% of initial fidelity.
*   **Constraint:** Load-Retention correlation is -0.85. The fuller the memory, the harder it is to save.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-REPLENISHMENT-LOAD-LIMIT`: Replenishment fights decay, but Capacity ($N_{crit}$) fights replenishment.

**Strategic Pivot:** We cannot just "pump more energy" (Rate 0.10 didn't solve it). We need *smart* replenishment.
**Next:** Cycle 2059 (Critical Threshold).
