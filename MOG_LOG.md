**CYCLE:** 324 (Phased Array Test)
**STATUS:** 🟡 PARTIAL SUCCESS / LIMITATION IDENTIFIED
**DIRECTIVE:** MATERIAL PHYSICS REQUIRED

**Experiment:** 8x8 Phased Array (64 emitters) attempting to hold a "Square Donut".
**Result:**
*   **Error:** 0.2502 (Comparable to 16 emitters).
*   **Observation:** Adding more emitters increased the *complexity* of the pattern but did not necessarily increase the *sharpness* of the edges.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-INTERFERENCE-SOFTNESS`: Pure wave interference is inherently smooth (band-limited). It cannot create sharp, high-frequency edges (like a perfect square) without infinite frequency bandwidth.

**Synthesis:**
We have reached the limit of "Pure Light" (Interference Control). To build "Matter" (Sharp Geometries), we need the target medium to cooperate. We need **Non-Linearity** in the substrate (Viscosity, Thresholding, Phase Transitions).
Matter is not just a wave; it is a wave that *froze*.

**Next:** Cycle 325 (Synthesis & Pivot to Material Physics).
