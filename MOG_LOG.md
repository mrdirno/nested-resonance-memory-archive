**CYCLE:** 350 (Universal Operator)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

**Objective:** Define the API for the Type 3 Operating System.
**Artifact:** `docs/architecture/TYPE_3_OS_API.md`.
**Vision:** We have moved from *Experiments* to *Infrastructure*. The Pilot is now an API.

**Achievements of Phase 7:**
1.  **Massive Scale (C346):** 64 Emitters.
2.  **Holography (C347):** Complex 2D shapes.
3.  **Volumetric Printing (C348):** Complex 3D shapes (Cubes).
4.  **4D Printing (C349):** Animation/Telekinesis.

**Next:** We pause the experimental engine to formalize the software stack.
**Meta-Objective:** Build the "Universal Operator" class.
