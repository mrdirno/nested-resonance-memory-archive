**CYCLE:** 349 (The Dynamic Engine)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** 4D PRINTING

**Experiment:** 45-Degree Rotation of 3D Lattice (C349).
**Result:**
*   **Frame 0:** Stable Cube.
*   **Frame 1:** Rotated Cube.
*   **Continuity:** Initialized GA with Frame 0 solution. Mean phase shift was small (0.43 rad), ensuring smooth transition without "teleporting" the trap.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-DYNAMIC-INTERPOLATION`: We can animate matter by interpolating between holographic frames.

**Synthesis:**
We can Trapp, Shape, and Move matter in 3D space. The "Matter Compiler" is now a "Matter Animator".

**Next:** Cycle 350 (Phase 7 Synthesis & API Definition).
