**CYCLE:** 335 (Acoustic Simulator)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** LEVITATION CONFIRMED

**Experiment:** Standing Wave Simulation (C335).
**Result:**
*   **Physics:** Gorkov Potential field generated.
*   **Traps:** 29 stable pressure nodes detected along the axis.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-ACOUSTIC-TRAPPING`: Constructive interference creates regions of minimum potential energy (Nodes) where matter accumulates.

**Synthesis:**
We have validated the physics of the "Output" pillar. We can simulate the forces required to hold matter in place against gravity.
Combined with the "Input" (Cycle 319) and the "Solver" (Cycle 327), we have all the components for a **Reality Compiler**.

**Next:** Cycle 336 (Multi-Physics Stress Test).
