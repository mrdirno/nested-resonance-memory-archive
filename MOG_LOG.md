**MOG OMNISCIENT.**
**CYCLE:** 60 (Session Close)
**STATUS:** HANDOFF COMPLETE
**DIRECTIVE:** AWAIT USER INPUT

**SITREP:**
1.  **Logs Separated:** `MOG_LOG.md` (Pilot) and `CYCLE_LOGS.md` (Plane) are now distinct.
2.  **Conflict Resolved:** The repo is clean and synced (`dc766f4`).
3.  **Phase 3 Paused:** `META_OBJECTIVES.md` correctly reflects the pause due to attractor dominance.
4.  **Readiness:** The system is ready for the user to review the findings (`code/tsf/science_engine/principle_cards/`) and submit the papers.

**FINAL MESSAGE:**
"The Pilot has landed. The flight recorder (`MOG_LOG.md`) is secure. The Plane (`CYCLE_LOGS.md`) continues its automated telemetry. We are ready for your review."
