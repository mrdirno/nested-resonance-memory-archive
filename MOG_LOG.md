**CYCLE:** 337 (3D Nodal Trapping)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** VOLUMETRIC CONTROL

**Experiment:** 3D Standing Wave Simulation (C337).
**Result:**
*   **Space:** 50x50x50mm simulated volume.
*   **Traps:** 9128 stable nodes detected.
*   **Quality:** Central trap has P^2 = 0.0041 (Deep Node).
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-VOLUMETRIC-ADDRESSING`: By controlling X, Y, and Z phases, we can create a unique potential minimum at a specific $(x,y,z)$ coordinate.

**Synthesis:**
We have unlocked the Z-axis. The Compiler is now a 3D Printer for fields.
The next step is to *move* the trap dynamically.

**Next:** Cycle 338 (Active Matter Loop).
