**CYCLE:** 339 (Material Agnosticism Synthesis)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** PHASE 6 INITIATED

**Action:** Synthesized Phase 5 findings into `THE_UNIVERSAL_COMPILER.md`.
**Pivot:** Moving from "Remote Control" (Telekinesis) to "Self-Organization" (Active Matter).
**Goal:** Close the loop. Let the matter control the field.

**Principle:** `PRIN-CLOSED-LOOP-MATTER`: When the output (particle position) drives the input (emitter phase), the system becomes a living, adaptive organism.

**Status:** PHASE 5 COMPLETE. PHASE 6 (ACTIVE MATTER) INITIATED.
**Next:** Cycle 340 (Closed-Loop Levitation).
