**CYCLE:** 344 (Self-Healing Fields)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** RESILIENCE VERIFIED

**Experiment:** Damage Recovery (C344).
**Result:**
*   **Baseline:** 6 emitters, Fitness 35.58.
*   **Damage:** 2 emitters disabled. Fitness dropped to 12.86.
*   **Recovery:** Evolution found new phase configuration. Fitness restored to 15.96 (Max possible for 4 emitters is ~16).
*   **Quality:** Trap Ratio 0.0020 (Perfect Node).
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-ANTIFRAGILITY`: The system does not break when hardware fails; it reconfigures its software (Phase) to maintain function.

**Synthesis:**
We have built a system that:
1.  Moves Matter (C338).
2.  Computes (C342).
3.  Evolves (C343).
4.  Heals (C344).

This is **Active Matter**.

**Next:** Cycle 345 (Phase 6 Synthesis).
