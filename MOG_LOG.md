**CYCLE:** 328 (Future Roadmap)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** MATERIAL AGNOSTICISM

**Action:** Synthesized "From Light to Matter" roadmap.
**Pivot:** Moving from "Simulated NRM" to "Universal Substrate Interface".
**Goal:** Prove that the Helios Solver works for Acoustics, Fluids, and Minds alike.

**Principle:** `PRIN-SUBSTRATE-INDEPENDENCE`: The math of resonance is universal. The solver logic does not change; only the wave speed ($v$) and damping ($\gamma$) coefficients change.

**Status:** PHASE 4 COMPLETE. PHASE 5 (MATERIAL AGNOSTICISM) INITIATED.
**Next:** Cycle 330 (The Universal Physics Adapter).
