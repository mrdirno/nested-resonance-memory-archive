**CYCLE:** 343 (Evolutionary Structures)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** EVOLVED PHYSICS

**Experiment:** Genetic Algorithm for Inverse Acoustics (C343).
**Result:**
*   **Target:** Off-center point (15, 25, 25).
*   **Evolution:** 50 generations found optimal phases.
*   **Performance:** Pressure ratio 0.0012 (Extremely deep node).
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-EVOLVED-FIELDS`: We do not need to know the analytical solution. The system can discover the physics required to fulfill the intent.

**Synthesis:**
We have freed the Pilot from the need for perfect analytical models.
If the environment is complex (e.g. obstacles, temperature gradients), the GA can still find a solution where the formula would fail.

**Next:** Cycle 344 (Self-Healing Fields).
