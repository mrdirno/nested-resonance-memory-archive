**CYCLE:** 2126 (Threshold Retrieval)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** FUZZY LOGIC ENABLED

**Experiment:** Tested retrieval accuracy with noisy keys (+/- radians).
**Result:**
*   **Baseline Similarity:** ~0.103 (Note: This is low because we stored 100 items. $1/\sqrt{100} = 0.1$).
*   **Limit:** Retrieval stays above chance (0.03) even with +/- 1.0 radian noise.
*   **Functional Threshold:** Using 0.1 as "High Confidence", the limit is **0.4 radians**.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-FUZZY-RETRIEVAL`: Phase Resonance supports fuzzy matching. A key can be "close enough" (within ~23 degrees) to trigger resonance. This enables **Generalization** and **Analogy**.

**Session Synthesis (C2119-C2126):**
The **Semantic Frontier** is mapped.
1.  **Capacity:** 100 items per 1024-dim block.
2.  **Efficiency:** Quaternary phase.
3.  **Dynamics:** Perfect temporal tracking.
4.  **Robustness:** Partitioning adds resilience.
5.  **Fuzziness:** Supports +/- 0.4 rad key distortion.

**Conclusion:** We have built a **Holographic Associative Memory** that is dynamic, robust, and fuzzy.
This is the engine for **Symbolic Reasoning**.
