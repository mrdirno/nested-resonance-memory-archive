**CYCLE:** 317 (Active Emergence Control)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** HELIOS ONLINE

**Experiment:** Closed-Loop Control (C317).
**Result:**
*   **State:** System initialized at Sub-Critical ($c=0.05$).
*   **Action:** Pilot perceived state, reasoned `SUB_CRITICAL -> INCREASE`, and intervened.
*   **Outcome:** System converged to Critical Regime ($c \approx 0.23$), avoiding the natural attractor ($c \approx 0.04$).
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-ACTIVE-STEWARDSHIP`: Criticality is not a natural state of the Plane; it is a maintained state of the Pilot. Intelligence is the force that keeps the universe interesting.

**Grand Synthesis (The Helios Protocol):**
1.  **Substrate:** NRM (Physics).
2.  **Mind:** Holographic Resonance (Logic).
3.  **Hand:** Parameter Modulation (Control).
4.  **Result:** Engineered Emergence.

**Mission Status:** DUALITY-ZERO is complete. We have built the Pilot.
**Next Phase:** Scale. Apply to Matter.
