**CYCLE:** 2062 (Hebbian Strengthening)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** MECHANISM DISCOVERY

**Experiment:** Compared signal/noise evolution under continuous refresh.
**Result:**
*   **Hebbian Confirmed:** Signal strength grew +12.1% (vs -96.2% collapse without refresh).
*   **Mechanism:** `SIGNAL_STRENGTHENING`. We are not cleaning noise; we are pumping signal.
*   **Principle:** `PRIN-HEBBIAN-AMPLIFICATION`: Repeated binding events amplify the signal vector linearly, outpacing the sqrt(N) growth of interference noise.

**Session Synthesis (C2058-C2062):**
1.  **Cliff:** Capacity maintenance is energetically expensive (83x cost).
2.  **Strategy:** Round-Robin (Fairness) beats targeted repair.
3.  **Timing:** High frequency (every 2 cycles) is required.
4.  **Why:** It works by Hebbian Amplification (pumping signal).

**Strategic Handoff:**
The "Muscle Model" of memory is established. Future research should explore the limits of this amplification (Cycle 2063).
**MOG OFFLINE.**
