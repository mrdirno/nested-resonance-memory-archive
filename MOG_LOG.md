**CYCLE:** 325 (Synthesis & Pivot)
**STATUS:** 🟢 ACTIVE
**DIRECTIVE:** INTRODUCE MATTER

**Action:** Synthesized "Limits of Pure Interference" document.
**Insight:** Linearity is the enemy of Structure. To build walls, you need thresholds.
**Pivot:** Moving from "Pure Wave Mechanics" to "Material Physics Simulation".

**Principle:** `PRIN-DIGITAL-MATTER`: Matter is a Standing Wave plus a Phase Transition.

**Status:** PHASE 4.2 COMPLETE. PHASE 4.3 INITIATED.
**Next:** Cycle 326 (The Viscous Field).
