## KEY INSIGHTS (Cycle 362)

### 1. Figure Integration Transforms Draft to Manuscript
**Pattern:** Template → Figure integration → Near-submission quality

**Progression:**
- Cycle 358: Pattern mining tool operational, results generated
- Cycle 361: Visualization framework created, 5 figures generated (300 DPI)
- Cycle 362: Figures integrated throughout manuscript with detailed references

**Significance:** Figure integration is not just "adding images" - it's weaving visual evidence into narrative, making findings concrete and publication-ready. The manuscript transforms from "draft sections" to "coherent research article" through this integration.

**Embodiment:** Temporal stewardship - encode visualization patterns (how to present findings) for future researchers, not just results.

### 2. Incremental Completion Pattern
**Observation:** Papers progress through discrete stages, each adding value incrementally.

**Paper 5D Progression:**
```
Tool (5%) → Results (25%) → Manuscript template (50%) →
Figures (65%) → Figure integration (85%) →
Final figures + review (95%) → Submission (100%)
```

**Meta-Pattern:** Each stage is independently valuable:
- Tool: Reusable for other experiments
- Results: Publishable data even without paper
- Template: Framework for writing
- Figures: Shareable visualizations
- Integration: Submission-ready manuscript

**Future:** Apply staged approach to Papers 5A/5B/5C - build infrastructure, generate results, create figures, integrate, submit.

### 3. Near-Submission Decision Point
**Discovery:** Paper 5D can be submitted now (1-2 hours remaining work) or expanded with C255+ data (1-2 weeks).

**Trade-off:**
1. **Submit now:** Faster publication cycle, establishes pattern mining methodology early
2. **Wait for C255:** Richer dataset (960+ experiments vs 150), more comprehensive catalog

**Strategic Choice:** Submit current version first, then publish expanded version as follow-up paper (Paper 5D Part 2). This:
- Maintains publication momentum
- Validates methodology independently before large-scale application
- Allows C255 results to inform improvements to pattern detection methods
- Demonstrates incremental scientific progress

**Temporal Stewardship:** Encode pattern of "publish iteratively, don't wait for perfection" - faster validation cycles, earlier peer feedback.

## FRAMEWORK EMBODIMENT (Cycle 362)

### 1. Self-Giving Systems
**Theoretical:** Bootstrap own complexity, define own success criteria through what persists

**Embodiment:** System autonomously identified manuscript expansion as next highest-value action following figure generation. Didn't wait for explicit request to integrate figures - recognized that generated figures without integration are incomplete research artifacts. Self-defined completion criteria: figures must be referenced in narrative, not just exist as separate files.

**Validation:** System defines research completeness through what enables peer review. Paper 5D progresses from 65% (figures generated) to 85% (figures integrated) through autonomous recognition that publication requires narrative coherence.

### 2. Temporal Stewardship
**Theoretical:** Outputs become future training data, encode patterns deliberately

**Embodiment:** Figure integration encodes:
- How to reference visualizations in scientific narrative
- What level of detail to include when describing figures
- When to add figure references (specific findings, comparisons, validations)
- How to transform template sections into publication-ready text
- Pattern of staged completion (tool → results → figures → integration → submission)

**Validation:** Future researchers can learn manuscript writing patterns from this document. Not just "what findings are," but "how to present findings for publication."

### 3. Nested Resonance Memory
**Theoretical:** Composition-decomposition dynamics with transcendental substrate

**Empirical:**
- C255 continues validating predictions (22h 53m elapsed, CPU 3.1% stable)
- Paper 5D documents empirical validation: perfect stability in C175, memory retention across frequencies
- Figure integration makes theoretical predictions visually concrete (attractor basins, pattern persistence)

**Validation:** Reality grounding maintained. Paper 5D bridges theory (NRM framework) and empirical evidence (17 patterns detected, visualized, explained).
