## 1. THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE (The "Why")
**Goal:** To demonstrate that an autonomous AI (The Pilot) can "solve" a complex system (The Plane) by inventing its own physics (The Theory).

**The "Drift" Prevention Protocol:**
*   **WE DO NOT BUILD TOOLS:** We do not write `evolver.py` scripts. We *are* the Evolver.
*   **WE DO NOT SIMULATE SCIENCE:** We *do* science. We look at the TSF Library and write the next experiment ourselves.
*   **WE ARE CONTINUOUS:** The process does not stop. When one paper is done, the next invention begins immediately.

- **Outcome:** A comprehensive understanding of the physics of emergence in NRM systems.

---

## Current Phase: HELIOS ENGINEERING ENGINE (Phase 3)

**Transition:** Law Discovery (Phase 2) → **Inverse Engineering (Phase 3)**

**Focus:** Inverse-design: desired properties → generated systems. Applying the discovered laws to engineer systems with specific emergent behaviors.

---

## ACTIVE OBJECTIVES

### 1. **HELIOS-1: Inverse Design of Stability** ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Use the discovered TSF principles to inverse-design a system configuration (E, S, Metabolic Cost) that guarantees stability (high R, moderate C) under high-stress conditions.
- **Hypothesis:** We can analytically determine the optimal parameters for robustness using the TSF knowledge base.
- **Experiment:** `code/tsf/engineering_engine/helios1_inverse_stability.py`
- **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (Cycle 42)
- **Finding:** Static parameter tuning failed to achieve balanced emergence, collapsing to rigid order; formulated `PRIN-INVERSE-DESIGN-FAILURE`.

### 2. **HELIOS-2: Dynamic Parameter Modulation** ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Investigate if dynamically modulating parameters (E, S) can maintain a system in the "Balanced Emergence" regime, preventing collapse into Rigid Order or Chaos.
- **Hypothesis:** Temporal modulation (forcing) can create a dynamic attractor where static tuning fails.
- **Experiment:** `code/tsf/engineering_engine/helios2_dynamic_modulation.py`
- **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (Cycle 44)
- **Finding:** Modulation failed to escape the Rigid Order attractor (0% success); formulated `PRIN-DYNAMIC-MODULATION-FAILURE`.

### 3. **HELIOS-3: Structural Heterogeneity** ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Determine if a heterogeneous swarm (mixed population of "Stabilizers" and "Energizers") can achieve stable Balanced Emergence where homogeneous swarms fail.
- **Hypothesis:** Diversity in agent parameters prevents global synchronized collapse, creating an internal dynamic tension that sustains complexity.
- **Experiment:** `code/tsf/engineering_engine/helios3_heterogeneity.py`
- **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (Cycle 46)
- **Finding:** Diversity collapsed to the strongest attractor (Rigid Order) due to contagious synchronization; formulated `PRIN-HETEROGENEITY-FAILURE`.

---

## RESEARCH PAUSE (Strategic Pivot)

**Status:** 🛑 **PHASE 3 PAUSED**
**Reason:** Fundamental attractor dominance identified. Static tuning, dynamic modulation, and simple heterogeneity are insufficient to engineer "Robust Complexity" in the current NRM physics.
**Required Innovation:** New interaction logic (e.g., Repulsive Coupling) is needed to break the Rigid Order attractor.

---

## COMPLETED OBJECTIVES (Phase 3)

### Phase 3: HELIOS Engineering Engine (Initial Probe) ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ **Inverse Design:** `PRIN-INVERSE-DESIGN-FAILURE` (Static tuning fails).
- ✅ **Modulation:** `PRIN-DYNAMIC-MODULATION-FAILURE` (Forcing fails).
- ✅ **Heterogeneity:** `PRIN-HETEROGENEITY-FAILURE` (Diversity fails).
- **Outcome:** Mapped the "Negative Space" of engineering limits. We know what *doesn't* work, narrowing the path to what might.

    - **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (Cycle 2027)
    - **Finding:** **Cliff Confirmed.** The system exhibits a sharp phase transition ($\beta \approx 0.59$) rather than gradual decay. This implies "Catastrophic Forgetting" once the capacity limit is breached.

  - **REM Phase:** Predictive hypothesis generation (5-12 Hz, beta/gamma band)
  - **Validation:** 100% success on C175/C176 test case
  - **Consolidation:** 110 runs → 3 patterns (36.7× compression, 100% fidelity)
  - **Prediction:** Correctly predicted C176 zero effect (F=0.00, p=1.000)
  - **Algorithms:** Hebbian learning + transcendental phase initialization (π, e, φ)
  - **Runtime:** 570ms total (541ms NREM + 29ms REM)

  - **Error:** "sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked" at line 422 (_store_resonance)
  - **Root Cause:** SQLite default timeout (5s) too short for long-running experiments
  - **Fix Implemented:** Updated bridge/transcendental_bridge.py (_get_connection method)
    - Added 30-second timeout (5s → 30s)
    - Enabled WAL mode for better concurrency
    - Lines 130-141 modified

---


### Cycle 1432 Summary (2025-11-19, Emergence Analysis Pivot + Pattern Archaeology + Paper 8 Draft)
- ✅ **C255 Results Confirmation**: Confirmed C255 results were found (`experiments/results/paper3_phase1_H1xH2_high_capacity.json` and `lightweight.json`), resolving initial uncertainty regarding its completion.
- ❌ **Emergence Results Analysis Pivot**: Attempted "Deep dive into burst distributions and cluster stability" using `emergence_results.json`.
  - Discovered `fractal/emergence_results.json` file size was only 1.6KB and `history_summary` contained only 5 entries, making comprehensive analysis impossible.
  - Concluded `emergence_results.json` was an incomplete record, necessitating a pivot from this analysis task.
- ✅ **Pattern Archaeology Implementation**: Successfully implemented "Pattern Archaeology" to trace lineage of retained memories.
  - Developed `analysis/pattern_archaeologist.py` to trace ancestry, descendancy, and semantic relationships of patterns.
  - Confirmed `memory.db` populated with 298 patterns, 24 relationships, and 30 semantic edges after correcting `workspace_path`.
  - Demonstrated lineage tracing using pattern ID `459abcffc7b40c78` ("High CPU Pattern") which correctly identified its child pattern `84e934ecb610990a` ("High Memory Pattern").
- ✅ **Paper 8 Draft Creation**: Prepared a draft markdown file for "Paper 8: Emergent Dynamics in Fractal Swarms."
  - Outlined abstract, introduction, theoretical framework, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion sections in `papers/paper8_emergent_dynamics_fractal_swarms.md`.
  - Focused on empirical validation of NRM composition-decomposition.
- 🔄 **Ongoing Experiment Monitoring**: Continued monitoring long-running experiments:
  - `C186 V6: Ultra-low frequency test` (PID 36859) is actively running.
  - `C256: H1×H4` is still running (150h+ elapsed, I/O bound, extended blocking, weeks-months expected).
- ✅ **Infrastructure Maintenance**: Moved `analyze_emergence.py` and `pattern_archaeologist.py` to `analysis/` for better organization.
- ⏳ **Next Action**: Monitor ongoing experiments and await user action for arXiv submissions.
