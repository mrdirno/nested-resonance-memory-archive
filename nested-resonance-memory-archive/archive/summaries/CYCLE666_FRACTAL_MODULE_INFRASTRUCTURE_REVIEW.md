## WORK COMPLETED

### 1. C256 Status Monitoring

**Current Metrics (as of Cycle 666):**
- CPU time: 31:12.34h (31 hours 12 minutes)
- Elapsed wall time: 12h 33m
- Baseline (C255 unoptimized): 20.1h
- Variance: +11.1h (+55.2% over baseline)
- **New milestone:** Crossed 31h threshold (previous: 30h in Cycle 664)
- Process status: Running healthy (PID 31144)
- Output file: Not yet created (still processing)

**Variance Progression:**
- Cycle 636: +10% (22.1h)
- Cycle 657: +35% (27.1h)
- Cycle 662: +45% (29.2h)
- Cycle 664: +50% (30.1h, crossed 30h threshold)
- **Cycle 666: +55% (31.2h, crossed 31h threshold)**

**Pattern:** Non-linear acceleration (slow start → faster progression)

**Research Value:** Runtime variance itself is valuable data for Paper 3 optimization analysis (demonstrates unoptimized script behavior baseline for comparison with optimized versions).

### 2. Fractal Module Comprehensive Review

**Module Structure (1,674 total lines):**

| File | Lines | Purpose | Status |

   - ✅ No equilibrium (perpetual motion design)

2. **Reality Grounding:**
