 * block — the repo default (playwright.config.ts) targets :5173, which on this
 * machine is Persona 500, not this app (scar: a playwright run silently reused
 * another project's dev server on 5173). Override with COLLAGE_BASE_URL to run
 * against a deployed release.

 * SERIAL, one worker: T2 drives a full offline render, and parallel renders on
 * one machine contend for the decoder the measurement is about.
