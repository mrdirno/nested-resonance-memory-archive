 * block — the repo default (playwright.config.ts) targets :5173, which on this
 * machine is Persona 500, not this app (scar: a playwright run silently reused
 * another project's dev server on 5173). Override with COLLAGE_BASE_URL to run
 * against a deployed release.
 *
 * SERIAL, one worker. Every assertion here is a measurement of how much the
 * canvas changed between two moments a couple of seconds apart, and parallel
 * workers on one machine contend for exactly the resource that makes those
 * moments mean anything.
