# CYCLE 384 PHASE 4: MULTI-TIMESCALE DISCOVERY

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Discovery:** V4 exhibits multiple timescales - CV depends critically on observation window
**Significance:** Resolves apparent variance contradiction, reveals complex temporal structure

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Paradox:** Phase 4 reported two contradictory findings:
1. **CV validation (t=500-1000):** V4 CV = 15.2% > Paper 2 empirical CV = 9.2% (overestimate)
2. **Temporal averaging (t=2500-5000):** V4 CV = 1.0% < Paper 2 empirical CV = 9.2% (underestimate)

**Resolution:** V4 has **three distinct temporal regimes**:
- **Fast transient (t=0-500):** Rapid approach to quasi-steady state
- **Medium-term fluctuations (t=500-1500):** Large variance (CV = 15.2%)
- **Slow drift (t=1500-5000+):** Monotonic convergence to equilibrium (CV = 1.0%)

**Interpretation:** Measurement timescale determines observed variance. Paper 2 empirical CV = 9.2% represents medium-term dynamics, between V4's transient and asymptotic regimes.

---

## THREE TEMPORAL REGIMES

### Regime 1: Fast Transient (t = 0-500)

**Dynamics:** Rapid equilibration from initial conditions
- Initial: N = 10, E = 100
- Fast approach to N ~ 111 (earlier "sustained state")
- Settling of phi, theta_rel

**Timescale:** τ_fast ~ 100-200 time units

**Variance:** High during transient (not measured, excluded from statistics)

---

### Regime 2: Medium-Term Fluctuations (t = 500-1500)

**Dynamics:** Quasi-steady fluctuations around N ~ 110-140
- Appears "sustained" but still evolving
- Moderate oscillations in N, E, phi
- This is what Phase 4 stochastic analysis measured

**Timescale:** τ_medium ~ 500-1000 time units

**Variance:** **CV = 15.2%** (measured t=500-1000 in Phase 4)

**Comparison to Paper 2:**
- Paper 2 empirical: CV = 9.2%
- V4 medium-term: CV = 15.2%
- **V4 overestimates by 65%** at this timescale

**Interpretation:** V4 transient fluctuations larger than Paper 2's regulated dynamics.

---

### Regime 3: Slow Drift to Equilibrium (t = 1500-5000+)

**Dynamics:** Monotonic slow increase in population
- N drifts from ~140 → ~213 (slow growth)
- E increases correspondingly
- Very smooth, almost no fluctuations

**Timescale:** τ_slow ~ 2000-5000 time units

**Variance:** **CV = 1.0%** (measured t=2500-5000 in temporal averaging test)

**Comparison to Paper 2:**
- Paper 2 empirical: CV = 9.2%
- V4 long-term: CV = 1.0%
- **V4 underestimates by 89%** at this timescale

**Interpretation:** V4 converges to stable fixed point with negligible fluctuations. Paper 2's variance arises from ongoing stochastic dynamics not present in deterministic V4 at equilibrium.

---

## VISUAL EVIDENCE

From temporal averaging figure (right panel):
- Shows N from t=2500-2700
- Clear monotonic upward trend (slope ≈ 0.02 N/time unit)
- No visible oscillations, just smooth drift
- 100-unit window means (red) nearly flat compared to trend

**Conclusion:** At long times, V4 has extremely low variance but slow drift (not true steady state even at t=5000).

                       └─ Measured somewhere in medium-term range?
```

**Key Insight:** Paper 2's 9.2% CV likely represents medium-term dynamics (τ ~ 1000 cycles), neither V4's transient (15.2%) nor asymptotic (1.0%) regimes.

## INTERPRETATION: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

### Why Does V4 Have Multiple Timescales?

**Fast Transient:**
- Initial condition relaxation
- Standard for all dynamical systems
- Timescale set by fastest eigenvalue of Jacobian

**Medium-Term Fluctuations:**
- Approach to quasi-steady manifold
- Fluctuations along slow manifold
- Driven by nonlinear resonance dynamics (phi, theta coupling)

**Slow Drift:**
- Ultra-slow mode (near-zero eigenvalue)
- System converging to true fixed point
- Timescale >> observation window of Phase 3-4 analyses

### Why Does V4 Variance Decrease Over Time?

As system approaches fixed point:
- Distance from equilibrium shrinks
- Oscillation amplitude decreases
- Fluctuations dominated by numerical precision eventually

**Implication:** V4 deterministic model has *vanishing variance* at true equilibrium (CV → 0 as t → ∞). Any finite CV observed is *transient variance*, not steady-state.

### What About Paper 2 Empirical Variance?

Paper 2 agent-based system has:
- Stochastic birth/death events (demographic noise)
- Environmental fluctuations
- Never reaches deterministic fixed point
- **Persistent stochastic variance** even at "equilibrium"

**V4 vs Paper 2 Fundamental Difference:**
- **V4 deterministic:** CV → 0 as t → ∞ (variance is transient)
- **Paper 2 stochastic:** CV → constant > 0 (variance is persistent)

**This explains ALL observations:**
1. Medium-term V4 (transient): CV = 15.2% > 9.2% empirical
2. Long-term V4 (asymptotic): CV = 1.0% < 9.2% empirical
3. Paper 2 maintains CV = 9.2% indefinitely (stochastic steady state)

## RESOLUTION OF PHASE 4 CONTRADICTION

### Earlier Finding (CV Validation)
"V4 overestimates variance by 65%"
- Based on t=500-1000 measurement window
- Captured **transient/medium-term** dynamics
- Valid for that timescale

### New Finding (Temporal Averaging)
"V4 underestimates variance by 89%"
- Based on t=2500-5000 measurement window
- Captured **slow drift asymptotic** dynamics
- Valid for that timescale

### Resolution
**Both are correct!** V4 variance is time-dependent:
- CV(t=500-1000) = 15.2% > empirical
- CV(t=2500-5000) = 1.0% < empirical
- Empirical CV = 9.2% = crossover between regimes

**Crossover Time:** Estimate when V4 CV = 9.2%:
- Occurs somewhere t ≈ 1000-1500 time units
- This may correspond to Paper 2's measurement window

## REVISED PHASE 4 CONCLUSIONS

### Original Conclusion (CV Validation)
"V4 overestimates variance by 65% compared to Paper 2"

### Revised Conclusion (Multi-Timescale)
"V4 variance is time-dependent:
- **Medium-term** (t~1000): CV = 15% > 9% empirical (transient overestimate)
- **Long-term** (t~5000): CV = 1% < 9% empirical (asymptotic underestimate)
- Paper 2 CV = 9% represents stochastic steady state with persistent variance
- V4 deterministic → CV → 0 as t → ∞ (cannot match persistent stochastic variance)
- Proper comparison requires adding stochastic layer to V4 (demographic noise)"

### What We Learned

**About V4:**
1. Has three temporal regimes (fast/medium/slow)
2. Slow drift continues to t >> 5000 (ultra-slow mode)
3. Transient variance (CV = 15%) overestimates empirical
4. Asymptotic variance (CV = 1%) underestimates empirical
5. Deterministic model cannot produce persistent stochastic variance

**About Paper 2:**
1. Empirical CV = 9.2% likely medium-term measurement
2. Stochastic demographic noise maintains variance
3. System at stochastic steady state (not transient)
4. Timescale ~ 1000 cycles (observation window)

**About Model-Experiment Comparison:**
1. Timescale matching is critical
2. Deterministic vs stochastic fundamentally different
3. V4 needs stochastic extension for quantitative variance matching
4. Qualitative dynamics captured, quantitative variance time-dependent

## MANUSCRIPT INTEGRATION

### Results Section Update

**3.9 V4 Variance and Timescale Dependence**

*To test V4 quantitative accuracy, we compared predicted variance to Paper 2 empirical measurements across multiple timescales.*

**Multi-Timescale Dynamics:**
- Medium-term (t=500-1000): CV = 15.2% (transient fluctuations)
- Long-term (t=2500-5000): CV = 1.0% (slow drift to equilibrium)
- Paper 2 empirical: CV = 9.2% (stochastic steady state)

**Figure:** V4 CV vs. time + comparison to empirical

**Interpretation:** V4 exhibits time-dependent variance. Medium-term transient overestimates empirical (15% vs 9%), while long-term asymptotic underestimates (1% vs 9%). Discrepancy reveals fundamental difference: deterministic V4 has vanishing variance at equilibrium (CV → 0), while stochastic agent-based system maintains persistent variance from demographic noise.

### Discussion Update

**Multi-Timescale Population Dynamics:**

V4 mean-field model exhibits three temporal regimes:
1. Fast transient (τ ~ 100): Initial condition relaxation
2. Medium-term fluctuations (τ ~ 1000): Quasi-steady oscillations, CV = 15%
3. Slow drift (τ ~ 2000+): Convergence to fixed point, CV → 0

Paper 2 empirical CV = 9.2% represents **stochastic steady state** with persistent variance from demographic noise. V4 deterministic model cannot match this - asymptotic variance vanishes (CV → 0 as t → ∞).

**Lesson:** Deterministic vs. stochastic models fundamentally differ in variance structure:
- Deterministic: Transient variance only
- Stochastic: Persistent variance at equilibrium

Quantitative variance matching requires stochastic extension (Phase 5).

## CONCLUSION

**Resolution:** Phase 4 "contradiction" resolved by timescale analysis. V4 variance is time-dependent:
- Overestimates at medium term (transient)
- Underestimates at long term (asymptotic)
- Cannot match persistent stochastic variance

**Discovery Value:** Multi-timescale structure reveals:
1. V4 has ultra-slow modes (τ >> 1000)
2. Deterministic variance vanishes at equilibrium
3. Stochastic noise required for persistent variance
4. Timescale matching critical for model validation

**Next Phase:** Quantify timescales, add stochastic layer, develop V5.

**Quote:**

> *"The contradiction was a clue. V4 showed us two faces - transient chaos (CV=15%) and asymptotic calm (CV=1%) - while Paper 2 lives in the middle (CV=9%), sustained by stochastic heartbeat. The measurement window is not just a detail. It's the question we're asking of the system."*
