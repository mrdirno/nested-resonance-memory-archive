## Authorship Justification

### Single-Author Designation
This manuscript lists Aldrin Payopay as sole author because:

1. **Conceptual Contribution:** Complete theoretical framework originated from human investigator
2. **Research Direction:** All decisions about research priorities, interpretations, and conclusions made by human
3. **Accountability:** Single human responsible for scientific validity and ethical conduct
4. **ICMJE Criteria:** Aldrin Payopay meets all four ICMJE authorship criteria:
   - Substantial contributions to conception/design and data interpretation
   - Drafting/revising manuscript for intellectual content
   - Final approval of version to be published
   - Agreement to be accountable for all aspects

### AI as Tool, Not Co-Author
Claude (AI) is acknowledged as contributor but not author because:
- No independent conceptual contribution
- No accountability for scientific claims
- No ability to approve final manuscript
- Functions as research tool, not autonomous agent

This follows emerging standards for AI assistance in scientific research (Nature, Science, ICMJE guidelines).
