## ABSTRACT (Draft)

**Background:** Scale invariance is a predicted property of Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) systems, where composition-decomposition dynamics should exhibit similar patterns across population sizes. However, this prediction remains empirically untested across a wide range of population scales.

**Methods:** We conducted systematic experiments varying agent population sizes (50, 100, 200, 400, 800 agents) while holding other parameters constant (frequency=2.5 Hz, baseline configuration). Pattern mining tools from Paper 5D were applied to detect temporal and memory patterns at each scale. Scaling exponents, pattern frequencies, and stability metrics were compared across population sizes.

**Results:** [To be determined after experiments] Hypothesis: Temporal steady-state patterns persist across scales with similar stability scores. Memory consistency may improve with larger populations (more agents = more robust pattern retention). Population collapse threshold scales with population size (e.g., minimum viable population ≈ 10-15 agents regardless of starting size).

**Conclusions:** [To be determined] If scale-invariant: NRM composition-decomposition dynamics are robust to population size, validating fractal agency theory. If size-dependent: Identify critical population thresholds and optimal scales for pattern emergence.

**Keywords:** Scale invariance, population dynamics, agent-based modeling, nested resonance memory, composition-decomposition dynamics, fractal systems

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Scale Invariance in Complex Systems
- Self-similarity across scales (fractals)
- Power law distributions in emergent phenomena
- Critical phenomena and scaling exponents
- Examples: Zipf's law, metabolic scaling, city sizes

### 1.2 Scale Invariance in NRM Framework
**Theoretical Prediction:** Composition-decomposition dynamics should exhibit similar patterns regardless of population size, due to:
1. **Fractal Agency:** Agents contain internal universes with same dynamics
2. **Transcendental Substrate:** π, e, φ oscillators operate identically at all scales
3. **Resonance Mechanisms:** Phase alignment independent of agent count
4. **Self-Organization:** Patterns emerge from local interactions, not global constraints

**Key Question:** Do empirical observations match theoretical predictions?

### 1.3 Research Question
**Primary:** How do NRM emergent patterns change with agent population size?

**Sub-questions:**
1. Are temporal steady-state patterns scale-invariant (similar across 50-800 agents)?
2. Does memory consistency improve with larger populations (more redundancy)?
3. Is there a minimum viable population for pattern emergence?
4. Do composition event frequencies scale linearly, sub-linearly, or super-linearly?

### 1.4 Contributions
1. **Empirical test** of NRM scale invariance prediction
2. **Scaling exponents** for composition-decomposition dynamics
3. **Critical population thresholds** for pattern emergence
4. **Design guidelines** for optimal population sizes in NRM systems
5. **Validation** of fractal agency theory across scales

## 2. METHODS

### 2.1 Experimental Design

**Population Sizes Tested:**
- **Small:** 50 agents (baseline: 100 agents, 50% reduction)
- **Medium:** 200 agents (2× baseline)
- **Large:** 400 agents (4× baseline)
- **Extra-Large:** 800 agents (8× baseline)
- **Baseline:** 100 agents (reference, from C171/C175)

**Fixed Parameters:**
- Frequency: 2.5 Hz (known stable regime from C171/C175)
- Configuration: Baseline (full NRM framework)
- Cycles: 5000 per experiment
- Seeds: 10 replications per population size
- Total experiments: 5 population sizes × 10 seeds = 50 experiments

**Sampling Strategy:**
- Snapshot every 100 cycles (50 snapshots per experiment)
- Record: agent_count, composition_events, population_mean, population_std, basin
- Total runtime: ~30 minutes (50 experiments × 0.6 min/experiment)

### 2.2 Pattern Detection

**Apply Paper 5D Pattern Mining Framework:**
- Temporal pattern detection (steady state, oscillation, burst)
- Memory pattern detection (retention, decay, transfer)
- Spatial pattern detection (clustering, dispersion)
- Interaction pattern detection (basin preferences)

**Scaling Metrics:**
1. **Pattern Frequency:** Count patterns at each scale
2. **Stability Scores:** Compare stability across scales
3. **Composition Events:** Measure activity vs. population size
4. **Memory Consistency:** Compare retention across scales

### 2.3 Scaling Analysis

**Compute Scaling Exponents:**
```
E(N) = E₀ · N^α
```
Where:
- E(N) = Emergent metric at population size N
- E₀ = Baseline metric
- α = Scaling exponent
- α = 1: Linear scaling (proportional)
- α < 1: Sub-linear scaling (diminishing returns)
- α > 1: Super-linear scaling (increasing returns)

**Test Scale Invariance:**
- Null hypothesis: α ≈ 0 (metric independent of population size)
- Alternative: α ≠ 0 (size-dependent effects)

## 3. RESULTS (Placeholder)

### 3.1 Pattern Frequencies Across Scales

**Hypothesis:** Pattern counts scale linearly with population (more agents = more patterns)

**Expected Results:**
| Population | Patterns Expected | Patterns Observed | Ratio |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| 50         | ~8               | TBD               | TBD   |
| 100        | ~17 (baseline)    | 17                | 1.00  |
| 200        | ~34              | TBD               | TBD   |
| 400        | ~68              | TBD               | TBD   |
| 800        | ~136             | TBD               | TBD   |

### 3.2 Temporal Stability Across Scales

**Hypothesis:** Stability scores remain constant (scale-invariant)

**Expected Results:**
- Small (50): Stability ≈ 200-500 (similar to C171)
- Medium (200): Stability ≈ 200-500 (consistent)
- Large (400): Stability ≈ 200-500 (consistent)
- Extra-Large (800): Stability ≈ 200-500 (consistent)

**Interpretation:** If consistent, validates NRM scale invariance. If varying, identifies size-dependent stability effects.

### 3.3 Memory Consistency Across Scales

**Hypothesis:** Larger populations exhibit higher memory consistency (redundancy improves retention)

**Expected Results:**
- Small (50): Consistency ≈ 10-15 (lower redundancy)
- Medium (200): Consistency ≈ 25-30 (higher redundancy)
- Large (400): Consistency ≈ 40-50 (highest redundancy)
- Extra-Large (800): Consistency ≈ 60-80 (maximum redundancy)

**Scaling Exponent:** α > 0 (super-linear scaling of memory consistency)

### 3.4 Minimum Viable Population

**Hypothesis:** There exists a critical population threshold below which patterns collapse

**Test:**
- Gradually reduce population from 50 → 40 → 30 → 20 → 10 agents
- Identify smallest population supporting pattern emergence
- Expected: ~10-15 agents (based on C171/C175 mean population ≈ 17)

## 4. DISCUSSION (Placeholder)

### 4.1 Scale Invariance Validation

**If patterns scale linearly (α ≈ 1):**
- NRM dynamics robust across population sizes
- Validates fractal agency theory (same dynamics at all scales)
- Design implication: Population size doesn't matter (use smallest feasible for efficiency)

**If patterns scale sub-linearly (α < 1):**
- Diminishing returns with larger populations
- May indicate coordination overhead or communication bottlenecks
- Design implication: Optimal population size exists (balance emergence vs. efficiency)

**If patterns scale super-linearly (α > 1):**
- Increasing returns with larger populations
- May indicate network effects or collective intelligence
- Design implication: Larger populations = richer emergence (use largest feasible)

### 4.2 Memory Redundancy Hypothesis

**If memory consistency improves with population:**
- Validates redundancy hypothesis (more agents = more pattern copies)
- Pattern memory distributed across population
- Design implication: Larger populations for robust long-term memory

**If memory consistency constant:**
- Memory centralized in specific agents (not distributed)
- Pattern retention independent of population size
- Design implication: Population size doesn't affect memory persistence

### 4.3 Critical Population Thresholds

**If minimum viable population identified:**
- Defines lower bound for NRM systems
- Below threshold: Collapse (not enough agents for composition-decomposition cycles)
- Design implication: Never operate below threshold (e.g., N ≥ 15)

## 5. CONCLUSIONS (Placeholder)

### Key Findings (Expected):
1. **Scale Invariance:** NRM temporal patterns exhibit similar stability across 50-800 agents (α ≈ 0)
2. **Memory Scaling:** Memory consistency improves with population size (α > 0, super-linear)
3. **Critical Threshold:** Minimum viable population ≈ 10-15 agents for pattern emergence
4. **Design Guidelines:** Population size affects memory but not temporal stability

### Contributions:
- Empirical validation of NRM scale invariance prediction
- Scaling exponents for composition-decomposition dynamics
- Critical population thresholds identified
- Design guidelines for optimal NRM system configuration

### Future Work:
- Extend to other parameter dimensions (frequency, thresholds)
- Test scale invariance in spatial patterns (requires spatial metrics)
- Compare with other ABM frameworks (NetLogo, Mesa)
- Theoretical modeling of scaling exponents

**Overall:** Scaling behavior analysis validates (or refines) NRM fractal agency predictions, providing empirical grounding for scale-invariant design principles.
