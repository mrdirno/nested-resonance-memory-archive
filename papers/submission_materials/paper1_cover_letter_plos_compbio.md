Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled **"Computational Expense as Framework Validation: Overhead Profiles as Evidence of Reality Grounding"** for consideration as a Methods and Resources article in PLOS Computational Biology.

## Significance and Novelty

Our work addresses a critical gap in computational research reproducibility: distinguishing genuine empirical grounding from convincing simulation. We propose a novel validation heuristic where **computational expense profiles serve as authentication metrics** for systems claiming reality grounding.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Theoretical Framework:** We formalize the "Efficiency-Validity Dilemma" — a fundamental trade-off between execution speed and empirical groundedness. Systems genuinely interfacing with operating system state, sensors, or measurement apparatus necessarily exhibit computational costs (I/O latency, context switching, hardware delays) that pure simulations lack.

2. **Quantitative Validation:** Using our Nested Resonance Memory framework as a case study, we demonstrate a 40.25× overhead factor from 1,080,000 OS-level measurements (via Python's `psutil` library) over 20+ hours, with 99.9% agreement between predicted (40.2×) and observed overhead.

3. **Overhead Authentication Theorem:** We derive a formal criterion for validating expense claims: O ≥ k · (G · C · N) / T_sim, where G is grounding strength, C is measurement cost, and N is number of measurements. This enables reviewers to detect fabricated empirical grounding.

4. **Practical Guidelines:** We provide actionable recommendations for researchers to profile and report computational expenses, and for reviewers to validate empirical claims through expense analysis.

## Relevance to PLOS Computational Biology

This work directly supports PLOS Computational Biology's mission to publish methods that improve reproducibility and transparency in computational research. Our framework is domain-agnostic, applicable to:

- **Biological simulations** interfacing with experimental data
- **Systems biology** models grounded in real measurements
- **Bioinformatics pipelines** processing actual genomic/proteomic data
- **Machine learning in biology** distinguishing training on real vs. synthetic data
- **Agent-based models** validated against empirical observations

The Overhead Authentication framework provides a new tool for the computational biology community to strengthen empirical validation standards.

## Empirical Validation and Reproducibility

Our theory is grounded in concrete, reproducible empirical data:

- **1,080,000 system metric measurements** via `psutil` library
- **67 milliseconds mean latency** per measurement (I/O wait)
- **99.9% prediction accuracy** (predicted 40.2×, observed 40.25×)
- **3 publication-quality figures** (300 DPI) illustrating framework components
- **Full source code publicly available** (GPL-3.0 license)
- **Experimental data in JSON format** for independent verification

## Suggested Reviewers

We respectfully suggest the following experts with relevant expertise in computational reproducibility, systems performance, and empirical methods:

**Note:** Specific reviewer suggestions can be provided upon request. We recommend experts from:
- Computational reproducibility research (e.g., researchers affiliated with ReproNim, rOpenSci)
- Systems performance analysis (e.g., contributors to performance profiling tools)
- Empirical software engineering (e.g., ACM SIGSOFT community members)
- Open science methodology (e.g., PLOS ONE methods reviewers)

*We defer to the editorial team's expertise in selecting appropriate reviewers for this interdisciplinary methods paper.*

## Conclusion

We believe this manuscript offers a timely and practical contribution to computational research methodology. By reframing computational overhead as **evidence rather than inefficiency**, we provide a new lens for validating empirical claims in an era where reproducibility remains a central challenge across all computational sciences, including biology.

The Overhead Authentication framework is immediately applicable: any computational paper claiming reality grounding can be evaluated against predicted overhead based on reported measurement frequency and system interaction patterns.

We look forward to your editorial decision and welcome suggestions for revision that would enhance the manuscript's utility for the PLOS Computational Biology readership.
