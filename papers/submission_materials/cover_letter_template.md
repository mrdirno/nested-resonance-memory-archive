Dear Dr. [Editor Last Name],

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled **"Computational Expense as Framework Validation"** for consideration as a [manuscript type] in [Journal Name].

## Significance and Novelty

Our work addresses a critical gap in computational research reproducibility: distinguishing genuine empirical grounding from convincing simulation. We propose a novel validation heuristic where **computational expense profiles serve as authentication metrics** for systems claiming reality grounding.

**Key contributions:**

1. **Theoretical Framework:** We formalize the "Efficiency-Validity Dilemma" — a fundamental trade-off between execution speed and empirical groundedness in computational systems

2. **Quantitative Validation:** Using our Nested Resonance Memory framework, we demonstrate a 40× overhead factor (1.08M OS-level measurements over 20+ hours) with 99.9% agreement between predicted and observed costs

3. **Overhead Authentication Theorem:** We derive a formal criterion for validating expense claims: O ≥ k · (N · C) / T_sim, enabling reviewers to detect fabricated empirical grounding

4. **Practical Application:** We provide actionable guidelines for researchers to profile and report computational expenses, and for reviewers to validate empirical claims

## Relevance to [Journal Name]

This work directly addresses [Journal's mission statement related to reproducibility/methods/computational science]. Our framework is domain-agnostic, applicable to robotics, distributed systems, machine learning, and any field where computational models interface with measurable reality.

## Empirical Validation

Our theory is grounded in concrete empirical data:
- **1,080,000** system metric measurements via `psutil` library
- **67 milliseconds** per measurement (I/O wait latency)
- **99.9% match** between predicted (40.2×) and observed (40.25×) overhead
- **3 publication-quality figures** (300 DPI) illustrating the framework

## Target Audience

This manuscript will benefit:
- **Researchers** implementing reality-grounded computational systems
- **Reviewers** evaluating empirical claims in computational papers
- **Journal editors** establishing reproducibility standards
- **Open science advocates** promoting transparency in computational methods

## Ethical Considerations
