## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Why PLOS Computational Biology instead of Nature/Science?
**A:** Best balance of fit, readership, and acceptance probability. PLOS CompBio has explicit "Methods and Resources" section for novel computational approaches. Nature Methods requires broader empirical validation across multiple domains (achievable after C256-C260 completes).

### Q: Why submit to arXiv first?
**A:** Establishes timestamp and priority, enables community feedback, satisfies open research mandate, does NOT preclude journal submission, free and fast (1-2 days).

### Q: What if PLOS rejects?
**A:** Backup plan: Journal of Computational Science (strong fit) or ReScience Journal (fast, free, reproducibility-focused) or ACM SIGSOFT workshop (conference proceedings).

### Q: Can we submit enhanced version after C256-C260?
**A:** Yes! Initial submission establishes priority. After additional validation, can submit updated version to higher-impact journals (Nature Methods) or as revision to PLOS if under review.

### Q: What about author contributions (human + AI)?
**A:** Explicitly state hybrid collaboration: "Aldrin Payopay: Conceptualization, methodology, implementation. Claude: Theoretical formalization, literature review, figure generation." Transparency is essential.

### Q: How to handle reviewer concerns about AI co-authorship?
**A:** Emphasize: (1) Work is empirically grounded with real data, (2) AI formalized patterns discovered by human, (3) Human retains full responsibility for validity, (4) Open code/data enables independent verification.
