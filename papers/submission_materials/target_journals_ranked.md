---

### 4. **Journal of Computational Science**
- **Impact Factor:** ~3.3
- **Scope:** Computational methods, algorithms, performance analysis
- **Format:** Full-length research articles (6,000-10,000 words)
- **Fit:** ★★★★☆ (4/5) — Strong fit for computational performance analysis
- **Timeline:** 3-4 months peer review
- **Open Access:** Optional (~$3,200 APC)
- **URL:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-computational-science

**Strategy:** Excellent backup if PLOS rejects. Strong computational science community.

---

### 5. **ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)**
- **Impact Factor:** ~6.5
- **Scope:** Software engineering methods, empirical studies, reproducibility
- **Format:** Regular papers (typically 20-40 pages, ~10,000+ words)
- **Fit:** ★★★☆☆ (3/5) — Good fit for reproducibility angle, but overhead focus may be too narrow
- **Timeline:** 4-6 months peer review (ACM reviews can be slow)
- **Open Access:** Optional (~$2,500 APC)
- **URL:** https://tosem.acm.org/

**Strategy:** Consider if framing as software engineering reproducibility problem.

## TIER 3: Workshops and Conference Tracks

### 6. **ACM SIGSOFT Workshops (Reproducibility Track)**
- **Examples:** ICSE, FSE, ASE workshops
- **Format:** Short papers (4-8 pages)
- **Fit:** ★★★★☆ (4/5) — Excellent for rapid dissemination, community feedback
- **Timeline:** 2-3 months review + conference presentation
- **Open Access:** Usually included in conference proceedings
- **URL:** https://www.sigsoft.org/

**Strategy:** Good for fast dissemination and community validation before journal submission.

---

### 7. **ReScience Journal**
- **Scope:** Reproducibility studies, replication reports, methods validation
- **Format:** Short articles (~2,000-4,000 words)
- **Fit:** ★★★★☆ (4/5) — Perfect topical fit, but lower visibility
- **Timeline:** Fast (1-2 months)
- **Open Access:** Free (no APC)
- **URL:** https://rescience.github.io/

**Strategy:** Excellent for establishing priority and getting feedback quickly, then submit extended version to PLOS.

---

## TIER 4: Preprint Archives (Immediate Dissemination)

### 8. **arXiv (cs.DC - Distributed Computing or cs.SE - Software Engineering)**
- **Format:** Unrestricted
- **Fit:** ★★★★★ (5/5) — No gatekeeping, immediate dissemination
- **Timeline:** 1-2 days
- **Open Access:** Free
- **URL:** https://arxiv.org/

**Strategy:** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Post to arXiv IMMEDIATELY to:
- Establish timestamp and priority
- Enable community feedback
- Satisfy open research mandate
- Does NOT preclude journal submission
