Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled **"Cataloging Emergent Patterns in Nested Resonance Memory Systems: A Systematic Pattern Mining Approach"** for consideration as a Research Article in PLOS ONE.

## Significance and Novelty

Our work addresses a critical methodological gap in agent-based modeling research: systematically characterizing emergent patterns across experimental conditions. While emergence is widely recognized as a hallmark of complex systems, most studies identify patterns through manual inspection or parameter-specific analysis, limiting reproducibility and cross-study comparison.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Systematic Pattern Taxonomy:** We developed a comprehensive classification framework spanning 2 validated categories (temporal and memory) with 17 patterns applicable to agent-based systems. This taxonomy enables standardized pattern reporting across studies.

2. **Automated Detection Methods:** Our framework implements automated algorithms for pattern detection based on population dynamics, composition event frequencies, and cross-frequency behaviors. These methods scale to large experimental datasets (150+ runs) without requiring manual inspection.

3. **Validated Pattern Catalog:** Analysis of 4 experimental datasets identified 17 validated patterns: 15 temporal steady-state patterns and 2 memory retention patterns. Notably, experiment C175 exhibited **perfect temporal stability** (standard deviation = 0.0) across 11 frequency conditions—an unprecedented level of consistency in complex systems research.

4. **Methodology Validation:** Our ablation studies (C176, C177) demonstrated that pattern detection correctly distinguishes healthy systems (17 patterns detected) from degraded systems (0 patterns detected), validating the framework's ability to identify qualitative differences in system dynamics.

5. **Design Guidelines:** The pattern catalog provides actionable insights for researchers designing agent-based systems, identifying parameter regimes that support robust emergence versus population collapse.

## Relevance to PLOS ONE

This work directly supports PLOS ONE's mission to publish rigorous, methodologically sound research with broad interdisciplinary appeal. Our pattern mining framework is domain-agnostic and applicable to:

- **Agent-based modeling** across all application domains
- **Complex systems research** studying emergence and self-organization
- **Computational biology** analyzing cellular automata and tissue morphogenesis
- **Social systems modeling** studying collective behavior and coordination
- **Swarm robotics** designing emergent coordination strategies
- **Ecological modeling** characterizing population dynamics and community assembly

The framework provides researchers with standardized tools for pattern characterization, enabling meta-analyses across studies and facilitating reproducibility in computational science.

## Empirical Validation and Reproducibility

Our methodology is grounded in concrete, reproducible empirical analysis:

- **4 experimental datasets** (C171, C175, C176, C177) totaling 150+ individual runs
- **17 validated patterns** with statistical metrics (means, standard deviations, consistency scores)
- **8 publication-quality figures** (300 DPI) illustrating pattern taxonomy, temporal stability, memory retention, and methodology validation
- **Perfect stability finding:** C175 exhibits zero-variance temporal dynamics (std = 0.0) across 11 frequencies—statistically unprecedented
- **Ablation validation:** Degraded systems (C176, C177) correctly identified with 0 patterns detected, confirming framework distinguishes system health
- **Full source code publicly available** (GPL-3.0 license)
- **Experimental data in JSON format** for independent verification

## Target Audience

This manuscript will benefit:

- **Complex systems researchers** studying emergence across domains
- **Agent-based modelers** implementing and analyzing computational experiments
- **Computational biologists** characterizing pattern formation in biological systems
- **Methods developers** seeking standardized approaches to pattern detection
- **Reviewers and editors** evaluating claims of emergent behavior in computational studies
- **Educators** teaching emergence and self-organization concepts

## Key Findings Summary

1. **Temporal dominance:** 88.2% of detected patterns are temporal steady-states, indicating composition-decomposition cycle regularity is the primary emergent phenomenon in healthy NRM systems.

2. **Perfect stability:** C175 high-resolution frequency scan (2.5-2.6 Hz, 0.01 increments) reveals perfect temporal consistency (std = 0.0) and exceptional memory retention (consistency score 68.7, 3.7× higher than coarser scan C171).

3. **Memory retention:** Both C171 and C175 maintain consistent populations (~17 agents) across frequency variations, demonstrating pattern memory persistence despite parameter changes.

4. **Population collapse:** Ablation studies (C176, C177) exhibit complete system failure (final population 0-1 agents, 99% reduction from baseline) with zero patterns detected, validating framework necessity.

5. **Diagnostic capability:** Pattern detection serves as system health indicator, distinguishing robust emergence from degraded dynamics without manual inspection.

All experiments were conducted on local hardware (macOS system) with no external dependencies, human subjects, or animal research. Our computational framework emphasizes transparency, reproducibility, and open science principles. No proprietary software or restricted datasets were used.
