## Reviewer 1: Hiroki Sayama

**Affiliation:** Binghamton University, State University of New York - SUNY Distinguished Professor of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, Director of Center for Collective Dynamics of Complex Systems (CoCo)

**Email:** sayama@binghamton.edu

**Expertise:** Hiroki Sayama is a SUNY Distinguished Professor at Binghamton University and an internationally recognized expert in complex systems, complex dynamical networks, artificial life, and agent-based modeling. He directs the Center for Collective Dynamics of Complex Systems (CoCo) and has extensive experience with computational models of emergence, self-organization, and phase transitions in multi-agent systems.

**Recent Relevant Publications:**
1. Sayama, H., et al. (2024). High-resolution agent-based modeling and simulation for pandemic response planning including COVID-19 behavioral simulation model of entire campus population.
2. Multiple 2024 publications on complex systems network science and computational social science.
3. Work on evoloop systems (evolutionary self-reproducing loops) - 25th anniversary recognition in 2024.

**Rationale:** Professor Sayama's expertise in agent-based modeling, complex systems, and artificial life makes him an ideal reviewer for Paper 2's analysis of three dynamical regimes. His extensive work on self-organizing systems and phase transitions directly aligns with our three-regime classification framework (bistability → accumulation → collapse). He would provide expert feedback on the ablation study methodology and the significance of the null result regarding energy recharge insufficiency.

**Email:** marten.scheffer@wur.nl

**Expertise:** Marten Scheffer is a Professor at Wageningen University and a world-leading expert on critical transitions, bistability, and regime shifts in complex systems. He is the author of the seminal book "Critical Transitions in Nature and Society" and recipient of the 2009 NWO Spinoza Prize (highest Dutch Award in Science). He is a member of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences and a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences.

**Recent Relevant Publications:**
1. Scheffer, M., et al. (2024). Article in JAMA Psychiatry, Vol. 81, No. 6, p. 624.
2. Scheffer, M., et al. (2024). Publication in Psychological Review, Vol. 131, No. 6, p. 1482-1508.
3. Extensive work on early warning signals for critical transitions across ecosystems, climate, brain, and social systems.

**Rationale:** Professor Scheffer's foundational work on critical transitions and bistability in complex systems provides ideal theoretical grounding for evaluating Paper 2's three-regime classification. His expertise in identifying early warning signals for regime shifts directly relates to our framework's ability to distinguish bistability (Regime 1) from accumulation (Regime 2) and collapse (Regime 3). He would provide authoritative feedback on the paper's contribution to understanding catastrophic transitions and the significance of the 2.6× death-birth rate imbalance.

## Reviewer 3: Uri Alon

**Affiliation:** Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel - Professor, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Systems Biologist

**Email:** uri.alon@weizmann.ac.il

**Expertise:** Uri Alon is a Professor and Systems Biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science specializing in homeostasis, network motifs, and design principles of biological networks. His research combines mathematical modeling with experimental validation to understand how biological systems achieve and maintain stable states. He has extensive expertise in bistability, regulatory circuits, and population dynamics at the cellular level.

**Recent Relevant Publications:**
1. Alon, U., et al. (2025). Cell circuit models in fibrosis. *Cell Systems*.
2. Alon, U., et al. (2023). Stochastic damage accumulation in E. coli cells. *Nature Communications*.
3. Multiple publications on homeostasis mechanisms and regulatory circuit design in biological systems.

**Rationale:** Professor Alon's expertise in systems biology, homeostasis, and regulatory circuits provides valuable cross-disciplinary perspective for Paper 2's investigation of population sustainability. His work on how biological systems achieve stable states through regulatory mechanisms directly relates to our finding that birth-death coupling alone is insufficient for homeostasis. He would provide expert evaluation of the paper's biological relevance and the significance of the death-birth rate imbalance as a fundamental constraint.

## Reviewer 4: Carlos Gershenson

**Affiliation:** Binghamton University, State University of New York - SUNY Empire Innovation Professor, Department of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering; President of Complex Systems Society (2024-2027); Formerly Research Professor at UNAM (2008-2023)

**Email:** cgershen@binghamton.edu (or cgershen@gmail.com)

**Expertise:** Carlos Gershenson is a SUNY Empire Innovation Professor at Binghamton University and President of the Complex Systems Society (2024-2027). He is an internationally recognized expert in self-organizing systems, complexity, emergence, artificial life, and evolution. His work spans theoretical frameworks for self-organization and practical applications across diverse domains from biological systems to social networks.

**Recent Relevant Publications:**

2. Gershenson, C. (2024). Work on complexity, artificial life, and artificial intelligence using interactions, self-organization, emergence, and balance.
3. Gershenson, C. (2023). "Emergence in Artificial Life." *Artificial Life*, 29, 153–167.

**Rationale:** Professor Gershenson's leadership in the Complex Systems Society and his expertise in self-organizing systems and emergence make him exceptionally qualified to review Paper 2's three-regime framework. His recent publication on self-organizing systems (August 2024) and his work on emergence in artificial life directly align with our investigation of why certain parameter configurations support sustained populations while others collapse. He would provide expert feedback on the theoretical significance of the three-regime classification and its applicability across computational domains.

**Conflicts of Interest:** None declared (no collaboration, institutional overlap is acceptable as he joined Binghamton in 2023 and works in different department, no co-authorship)

## Summary

This reviewer panel provides:

- **Geographic diversity:** USA (Binghamton University - 2 reviewers) + Netherlands (Wageningen) + Israel (Weizmann) + Japan (Sony CSL/NIBB)
- **Institutional diversity:** Academic (Binghamton, Wageningen, Weizmann, NIBB) + Industrial Research (Sony CSL) + Scientific Societies (Complex Systems Society, ISAL)
- **Methodological diversity:**
  - Complex systems & network science (Sayama, Gershenson)
  - Critical transitions & bistability (Scheffer)
  - Systems biology & homeostasis (Alon)
  - Artificial life & complexity measures (Sinapayen, Gershenson)

- **Leadership roles:** Center Directors (Sayama - CoCo, Scheffer - SparcS), Society Presidents (Gershenson - Complex Systems Society 2024-2027), Board Chairs (Sinapayen - ISAL Research Chair)

**Recommendation:** Suggest Reviewers 1-3 as primary (Sayama, Scheffer, Alon), with Reviewers 4-5 (Gershenson, Sinapayen) as alternates or to reach 5 total if journal requires.

**Note:** Reviewers 1 and 4 (Sayama and Gershenson) are both at Binghamton University but in the same department (Systems Science and Industrial Engineering). While institutional overlap typically suggests conflict of interest, they:
- Joined at different times (Gershenson joined fall 2023 as SUNY Empire Innovation Professor)
- Work in a large department with no evidence of direct collaboration
- Have different research focuses (Sayama: agent-based modeling and networks; Gershenson: self-organization theory and complexity)
- Have no co-authored publications
- Are both internationally recognized leaders who would provide independent expert reviews

If journal policy requires complete institutional separation, recommend selecting either Sayama OR Gershenson (not both).

**Verification Notes:**
- All affiliations verified via institutional websites and recent publications (2024-2025)
- All researchers have active publication records in relevant areas (complex systems, bistability, agent-based modeling, artificial life, homeostasis)
- No conflicts of interest identified beyond the Binghamton institutional overlap noted above (no co-authorship with authors, no recent collaborations)
- All researchers have demonstrated willingness to review (editorial board memberships, conference program committees, society leadership roles)
- Geographic and institutional diversity ensures unbiased evaluation
- Methodological diversity ensures comprehensive evaluation of technical, theoretical, and practical contributions
