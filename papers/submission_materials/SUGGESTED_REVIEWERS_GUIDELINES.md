## Reviewer Identification Process

### Step 1: Literature Search
1. Use Google Scholar, PubMed, arXiv to search for recent papers (2020-2025)
2. Focus on journals where you plan to submit (PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology)
3. Note authors of highly cited papers in relevant areas

### Step 2: Verify Qualifications
- Check recent publication record (Google Scholar profile)
- Verify active research (papers in last 2-3 years)
- Check institutional affiliation (avoid same institution)
- Review editorial board memberships (indicates expertise and willingness to review)

### Step 3: Check Conflicts of Interest
- Verify no recent co-authorship (last 5 years)
- Check for institutional overlap
- Verify no personal/professional relationships beyond normal academic interaction

### Step 4: Compile Reviewer Information
For each suggested reviewer, provide:
- **Name:** Full name
- **Affiliation:** Institution and department
- **Email:** Contact email (check institutional website for current address)
- **Expertise:** 1-2 sentence description of relevant expertise
- **Recent Publications:** 2-3 relevant papers (titles + journals + years)
- **Rationale:** Why this reviewer is well-suited for your manuscript

### Step 5: Create Diversity
- Geographic diversity (different countries/continents)
- Institutional diversity (different universities/labs)
- Career stage diversity (mix of senior and junior researchers)
- Methodological diversity (theoretical + empirical + computational)

## Notes

**Do NOT Suggest:**
- Reviewers you don't genuinely believe are qualified
- "Friendly" reviewers who will give uncritical positive reviews
- Reviewers chosen solely because they cite your work
- Reviewers you've never read papers from

**DO Suggest:**
- Reviewers whose work you admire and cite
- Reviewers who are critical but constructive in their reviews
- Reviewers who have expertise in your specific methods/approaches
- Reviewers who understand the theoretical frameworks you're using

**Remember:**
- Editors are not obligated to use your suggestions
- Some journals verify suggested reviewers aren't recent collaborators
- Ethical reviewer suggestion is part of research integrity

## Resources

**Reviewer Databases:**
- Publons/Web of Science Reviewer Recognition (verify review activity)
- Journal editorial boards (find active reviewers in field)
- Conference program committees (identify experts)

**Citation Tools:**
- Google Scholar (find highly cited papers in your area)
- Web of Science (citation tracking)
- Scopus (author profiles and metrics)

**Institutional Directories:**

**Author:** Aldrin Payopay (aldrin.gdf@gmail.com)
**Repository:** https://github.com/mrdirno/nested-resonance-memory-archive
**License:** GPL-3.0

**Next Steps:**
1. Use this framework to identify 3-5 reviewers per paper (Papers 1, 2, 5D)
2. Verify qualifications and check for conflicts of interest
3. Compile reviewer information using template above
4. Include in journal submission cover letter

**Note:** This is a framework, not a list of specific reviewers. Identifying actual reviewers requires literature search and verification of current affiliations/expertise.
