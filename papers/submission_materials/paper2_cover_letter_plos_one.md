Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled **"From Bistability to Collapse: Energy Constraints and Three Dynamical Regimes in Nested Resonance Memory Framework"** for consideration as a Research Article in PLOS ONE.

## Significance and Novelty

Our work addresses a fundamental question in complex systems research: What mechanisms enable sustained populations in self-organizing fractal agent systems? Through systematic ablation studies across three progressively complete framework implementations, we identify fundamental constraints that prevent population homeostasis even under complete birth-death coupling with energy recharge mechanisms.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Three-Regime Classification:** We identify three distinct dynamical regimes exhibiting qualitatively different emergent behaviors:
   - **Regime 1 (Bistability):** Single-agent systems with sharp phase transition at f_crit ≈ 2.55%
   - **Regime 2 (Accumulation):** Birth-only multi-agent systems revealing architectural incompleteness
   - **Regime 3 (Collapse):** Complete birth-death coupling exhibiting catastrophic failure regardless of energy recharge parameters

2. **Quantitative Null Result:** Statistical analysis (F(2,27)=0.00, p=1.000, η²=0.000) confirms **zero effect of energy recharge** across 100× parameter variation, demonstrating that birth-death coupling is necessary but insufficient for sustained populations.

3. **Hypothesis Falsification:** Direct experimental test of energy pooling hypothesis (H1) yielded complete rejection (Cohen's d=0.0, p=1.0), redirecting research focus toward alternative sustainability mechanisms.

4. **Death-Birth Imbalance Quantified:** We measure fundamental asymmetry where death rate (~0.013/cycle) exceeds sustainable birth rate (~0.005/cycle) by 2.6×, identifying this imbalance as the primary constraint preventing homeostasis.

## Relevance to PLOS ONE

This work directly supports PLOS ONE's mission to publish rigorous, methodologically sound research with broad interdisciplinary appeal. Our framework is domain-agnostic and applicable to:

- **Complex systems research** studying self-organization and phase transitions
- **Agent-based modeling** across all application domains
- **Computational biology** analyzing population dynamics and stability
- **Artificial life** investigating conditions for sustained emergence
- **Multi-agent systems** designing robust collective behaviors
- **Systems biology** understanding bistability and regime transitions

The three-regime classification provides researchers with a theoretical framework for understanding why certain parameter configurations support emergence while others collapse, enabling more informed experimental design across computational disciplines.

## Empirical Validation and Reproducibility

Our methodology is grounded in concrete, reproducible empirical analysis:

- **150+ experiments** across three distinct regimes (C168-170, C171, C176 V2/V3/V4, C177 H1)
- **450,000+ validated computational cycles** ensuring statistical power
- **Multiple random seeds** (n=10-20 per condition) for robust statistical inference
- **Rigorous statistical testing:** ANOVA, t-tests, Cohen's d effect sizes, 95% confidence intervals
- **Perfect determinism verification:** Zero variance across random seeds confirms deterministic dynamics
- **4 publication-quality figures** (300 DPI) illustrating regime classification, parameter sweeps, and rate imbalances
- **Full source code publicly available** (GPL-3.0 license)
- **Experimental data in JSON format** for independent verification

## Target Audience

This manuscript will benefit:

- **Complex systems researchers** studying emergence, bistability, and phase transitions
- **Agent-based modelers** implementing self-organizing computational systems
- **Computational biologists** analyzing population dynamics and stability mechanisms
- **Artificial life researchers** investigating conditions for sustained evolution
- **Method developers** seeking frameworks for systematic ablation studies
- **Peer reviewers** evaluating claims of emergent behavior in computational papers

## Key Findings Summary

1. **Regime classification:** Three distinct dynamical regimes identified through systematic framework progression (single-agent → multi-agent birth-only → complete birth-death coupling).

2. **Null result significance:** Zero effect of energy recharge across 100× parameter variation (η²=0.000) demonstrates fundamental insufficiency of resource-based interventions.

3. **Hypothesis rejection:** Energy pooling (H1) hypothesis yielded Cohen's d=0.0 (no effect), redirecting research toward temporal asymmetries and architectural constraints.

4. **Death-birth imbalance:** Quantified 2.6× rate asymmetry (~0.013 vs ~0.005/cycle) identifies fundamental constraint preventing population homeostasis.

5. **Perfect determinism:** Zero variance across random seeds confirms dynamics are deterministic rather than stochastic, simplifying theoretical analysis.

3. **Open Access:** Immediate dissemination to global research community accelerates validation and extension by independent groups.

4. **Null Results Acceptance:** PLOS ONE's commitment to publishing rigorous negative results (zero recharge effect, H1 hypothesis rejection) supports scientific transparency.

6. **Large Readership:** Maximum visibility for regime classification framework ensures widespread impact and methodological uptake.

## Conclusion

We believe this manuscript offers a timely and important contribution to complex systems research. By providing **rigorous experimental evidence that energy recharge is insufficient for population homeostasis**, we establish fundamental constraints that must be addressed in future artificial life and agent-based modeling research.

The **zero recharge effect** (η²=0.000) represents a statistically robust null result that warrants dissemination to redirect research efforts toward more promising mechanisms. Our **hypothesis falsification** (H1 rejection with Cohen's d=0.0) exemplifies the scientific method's emphasis on testable predictions and transparent reporting of negative results.

The **three-regime classification** is immediately applicable: any agent-based modeling study can apply our framework to characterize their system's dynamical regime, test sustainability mechanisms, and validate architectural completeness.

We look forward to your editorial decision and welcome suggestions for revision that would enhance the manuscript's utility for the PLOS ONE readership.
