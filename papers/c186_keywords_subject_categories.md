## Competing Manuscripts and Differentiation

### Related Recent Papers (Search Terms Used)

**Search 1:** "hierarchical organization" AND "energy constraints"
- Few direct matches
- Most focus on metabolic scaling, not organizational structure

**Search 2:** "metapopulation" AND "compartmentalization"
- Limited integration of these concepts
- Spatial ecology work separate from compartmentalization theory

**Search 3:** "agent-based model" AND "hierarchical" AND "resilience"
- Growing field, but focus on social-ecological systems
- Less emphasis on fundamental organizational principles

**Our Differentiation:**
- **Novel comparison**: Hierarchical vs. single-scale under identical constraints
- **Quantitative metric**: α scaling coefficient (new measure)
- **Counter-intuitive result**: Hierarchy increases efficiency (opposite of prediction)
- **Mechanism clarity**: Risk isolation + weak connectivity explanation
- **Broad applicability**: Not tied to specific ecological or social context
