## SECTIONS INSERTED (Cycle 969)

### ✅ Section 2.1: NRM Framework Implementation (~70 lines)

**Source:** PAPER2_REVISED_RESULTS.md section 3.2
**Revisions:** MAJOR - Changed title from "Accumulation" to "Energy-Regulated Homeostasis", removed "architectural incompleteness" language, emphasized spawn failures as regulatory mechanism
**Status:** Complete

### ✅ Section 4.1: Energy-Mediated Homeostasis (~120 lines)
**Source:** PAPER2_REVISED_DISCUSSION.md section 4.1
**Revisions:** MAJOR - Rewrote to focus on homeostasis emergence, removed collapse/extinction discussion, added comparison to traditional population models
**Status:** Complete

## KEY NARRATIVE REVISIONS

### Old Interpretation (INVALID - Bug Artifacts)
- **C171:** "Accumulation regime due to incomplete architecture (missing death mechanism)"
- **C176 V2-V4:** "Collapse regime despite energy recharge"
- **Conclusion:** "Birth-death coupling necessary but not sufficient"

### New Interpretation (VALIDATED - C176 V6)
- **C171:** "Energy-regulated homeostasis via spawn failures"
- **C176 V6:** "Timescale-dependent constraint manifestation (88% success at 1000 cycles)"
- **Conclusion:** "Energy-constrained spawning sufficient for homeostasis"

**Critical Change:** Paper now demonstrates **successful** population regulation through energy constraints, not failure requiring additional mechanisms.
