## Figure 1: Multi-Scale Timescale Comparison

**File:** `c176_v6_multi_scale_comparison_final.png`
**Resolution:** 4170 × 1769 pixels @ 300 DPI
**Format:** PNG, 8-bit RGBA

**Caption:**

**Multi-scale timescale validation reveals non-monotonic spawn success pattern across experimental durations.** (A) **Micro-validation (100 cycles, n=3):** 100% spawn success, mean population 4.0 ± 0.0 agents, demonstrating initial energy-driven growth without constraint manifestation. (B) **Incremental validation (1000 cycles, n=5):** 88.0% ± 2.5% spawn success, mean population 23.0 ± 0.6 agents, exhibiting population-mediated energy recovery through distributed spawn load (spawns-per-agent ratio 2.08 ± 0.06). Four-phase trajectory: Initial decline → Transition → Stabilization → Recovery. (C) **Extended comparison (3000 cycles, C171 baseline n=40):** 23% spawn success, mean population 17.4 ± 1.2 agents, showing cumulative energy depletion dominates over extended timescales (spawns-per-agent ratio 8.38). **Key finding:** Non-monotonic pattern (100% → 88% → 23%) demonstrates timescale-dependent constraint manifestation: constraints **emerge through interaction** of population dynamics, compositional load, and temporal scale, not as fixed system properties.

## Figure 2: Seed-Level Validation and Hypothesis Testing

**File:** `c176_v6_seed_comparison_final.png`
**Resolution:** 4170 × 1769 pixels @ 300 DPI (estimated)
**Format:** PNG, 8-bit RGBA

**Caption:**

**Seed-level trajectories validate population-mediated energy recovery mechanism at 1000-cycle timescale.** (A) **Population trajectories (n=5 seeds):** All seeds exhibit stabilization around 20-25 agents with low inter-seed variance (CV=2.6%), demonstrating robust homeostatic regulation across different initial conditions. (B) **Spawn success trajectories:** Four-phase non-monotonic pattern replicated across seeds: Phase 1 (0-250 cycles) initial decline to 71-100%, Phase 2 (250-500 cycles) transition at 77-85%, Phase 3 (500-750 cycles) stabilization at 79-90%, Phase 4 (750-1000 cycles) **recovery** to 84-92%. Recovery phase (cycles 750-1000) shows sustained increase in spawn success despite continued compositional load. (C) **Hypothesis testing:** One-sample t-test vs. C171 baseline (μ₀=17.4): t(4)=8.63, p=0.0010, d=3.86, demonstrating significantly higher population at 1000 cycles compared to 3000-cycle baseline. **Interpretation:** Larger population at intermediate timescale distributes spawn selection pressure, enabling energy recovery between selections—system behaves as if energy reserves scale with population size.

## Figure 3: Incremental Trajectory Preliminary Analysis

**File:** `c176_v6_incremental_trajectory_preliminary.png`
**Resolution:** 4170 × 1769 pixels @ 300 DPI (estimated)
**Format:** PNG, 8-bit RGBA

**Caption:**

**Preliminary incremental trajectory analysis (1000 cycles, n=5 seeds).** Shows population growth and spawn success trajectories across 1000-cycle duration. Used for initial validation of four-phase pattern before final analysis. This figure documents early discovery of non-monotonic trajectory, prompting hypothesis formation for population-mediated energy recovery mechanism. Final analysis refined in Figure 2.
