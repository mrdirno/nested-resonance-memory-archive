## Section 3.6: Energy Pooling Hypothesis (C177)

### 3.6.1 Motivation and Design

Following the identification of the single-parent reproductive bottleneck (Section 3.5), we tested **Hypothesis 1 (H1): Energy Pooling**—the proposition that cooperative energy sharing within resonance clusters eliminates birth capacity constraints by distributing reproductive resources across multiple agents.

**Experimental Design:**
- **Conditions:** BASELINE (no pooling) vs POOLING (cooperative energy sharing)
- **Parameters:** f=2.5%, n=10 seeds per condition, 3,000 cycles
- **Energy recharge:** r=0.010 (C176 V4 rate)
- **Sharing fraction:** α=0.10 (10% contribution per cycle)
- **Mechanism:** Agents within resonance clusters contribute energy to shared pool; agents below spawn threshold (E<10.0) receive allocations prioritized by energy deficit

**Prediction:** If single-parent bottleneck is primary constraint, energy pooling should increase birth rate 3× (0.005 → 0.015 agents/cycle) and sustain populations (mean > 5 agents vs 0.49 baseline).

### 3.6.2 Results

**Primary Outcome:**

[INSERT TABLE 6: C177 H1 BASELINE vs POOLING Comparison]

| Metric | BASELINE | POOLING | Change | Cohen's d | p-value |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Mean Population | [VALUE] | [VALUE] | [+/-] | [VALUE] | [VALUE] |
| Birth Rate | [VALUE] | [VALUE] | [X]× | - | - |
| Death Rate | [VALUE] | [VALUE] | [+/-] | - | - |
| Death/Birth Ratio | [VALUE] | [VALUE] | [+/-] | - | - |

**Statistical Analysis:**
Independent samples t-test comparing mean populations (BASELINE vs POOLING) yielded [t([DF])=[VALUE], p=[VALUE]], indicating [significant/non-significant] difference. Effect size Cohen's d=[VALUE] suggests [negligible/small/medium/large/very large/huge] effect.

**Population Trajectories:**
[INSERT FIGURE 5: Population comparison bar plot]

POOLING condition showed [increased/similar/decreased] sustained populations compared to BASELINE ([VALUE] vs [VALUE] agents). [If increase: Birth rate improved [X]× ([VALUE] → [VALUE] agents/cycle), while death rate remained [stable/changed] ([VALUE] agents/cycle).] Death-birth ratio [improved/remained] from [VALUE]× to [VALUE]× (Figure 6).

### 3.6.3 Interpretation

**If STRONGLY CONFIRMED (p < 0.001, d > 1.5):**

Energy pooling successfully eliminated the single-parent reproductive bottleneck, validating the cooperative energy sharing mechanism. The [X]× birth rate improvement ([VALUE] → [VALUE]) demonstrates that distributing reproductive capacity across cluster members overcomes the architectural constraint where birth is concentrated in a single lineage while death affects all agents uniformly.

The achievement of sustained populations (mean=[VALUE] vs [VALUE] baseline) confirms that **cooperative emergence mechanisms enable population-level homeostasis** in complete birth-death coupled systems. Death-birth ratio improvement ([VALUE]× → [VALUE]×) shows progress toward balanced dynamics, though ratio remains above 1.0, suggesting [partial resolution/additional mechanisms required].

**Key finding:** Single-parent bottleneck **was the primary constraint** limiting populations in C176. Cooperative resource allocation at the agent level translates to population sustainability at the system level.

---

**If CONFIRMED (p < 0.01, d > 0.8):**

Energy pooling significantly increased sustained populations ([VALUE] → [VALUE] agents), confirming that single-parent bottleneck contributes to population collapse. The [X]× birth rate improvement ([VALUE] → [VALUE]) demonstrates partial success in distributing reproductive capacity across cluster members.

However, populations remained below predicted levels (observed=[VALUE], predicted>5), suggesting **single-parent bottleneck is a significant but not sole constraint**. Death-birth ratio improved ([VALUE]× → [VALUE]×) but remains substantially above 1.0, indicating that cooperative energy sharing alone is insufficient for full homeostasis.

**Key finding:** Single-parent bottleneck is **one of multiple constraints** limiting populations. Synergistic combinations with other hypotheses (H1+H2, H1+H4, H1+H5) warranted.

---

**If MARGINAL SUPPORT (p < 0.05, d > 0.5):**

Energy pooling showed modest population increase ([VALUE] → [VALUE] agents), providing marginal evidence for single-parent bottleneck contribution. The [X]× birth rate improvement ([VALUE] → [VALUE]) suggests cooperative mechanisms have measurable but limited effects under current parameters.

The weak effect size (d=[VALUE]) indicates **single-parent bottleneck may be overshadowed by other constraints** (recovery lag, continuous death activity). Death-birth ratio marginally improved ([VALUE]× → [VALUE]×), insufficient to approach balanced dynamics.

**Key finding:** Single-parent bottleneck has **minor influence** on population collapse. Alternative hypotheses (H2: external sources, H4: composition throttling, H5: multi-generational recovery) should be prioritized.

---

**If REJECTED (p >= 0.05 or d < 0.5):**

Energy pooling showed no significant effect on sustained populations ([VALUE] → [VALUE] agents, p=[VALUE], d=[VALUE]). Birth rate remained nearly identical ([VALUE] vs [VALUE] agents/cycle), providing no evidence that distributing reproductive capacity across agents overcomes population collapse.

This **null result falsifies** the hypothesis that single-parent bottleneck is the primary constraint limiting populations in C176. Death-birth ratio remained stable ([VALUE]× → [VALUE]×), indicating cooperative energy sharing does not address the fundamental imbalance between death and birth processes.

**Key finding:** Single-parent bottleneck is **NOT the primary constraint**. Other structural asymmetries—recovery lag (1,000-cycle bottleneck) or continuous death activity (100% uptime)—dominate population dynamics. Focus should shift to H2 (external sources), H4 (composition throttling), or H5 (multi-generational recovery).
