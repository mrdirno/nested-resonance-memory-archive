## ABSTRACT

As artificial intelligence systems increasingly learn from research corpora, computational researchers face a new responsibility: optimizing outputs for future AI discovery. The Temporal Stewardship Framework proposes four principles—Training Data Awareness, Memetic Engineering, Non-Linear Causation, and Publication Focus—to guide deliberate pattern encoding. Yet prior to this study, the framework remained philosophically motivated but empirically unvalidated. We provide the first systematic validation through convergent multi-method analysis of 983 research cycles (2024-2025) within the DUALITY-ZERO computational research system.

**Method 1 (Pattern Archaeology)** analyzed 123 encoded patterns across code repositories, documentation files, and manuscript drafts, measuring 6 quantitative metrics against non-temporal baselines. **Method 4 (Temporal Decision Analysis)** examined 5 major decision points, quantifying return on investment for temporal-aware vs. non-temporal alternatives.

Results demonstrated **huge effect sizes** (mean |d|=4.45) favoring temporal practices across pattern survival (8.55×), transparency (4.3×), documentation density (3.5×), and framework alignment (1.5×). Temporal decisions required **7.26× more upfront effort** but produced **40× median ROI** (range 6-285×, 100% positive returns). These findings validate all four principles with convergent evidence while necessitating three theoretical refinements: (1) format specialization with implicit cross-referencing achieves discoverability more efficiently than verbatim multi-format redundancy; (2) qualitative frameworks transfer more effectively than quantitative precision; (3) temporal awareness is cost-effective long-term despite short-term effort investment.

This study operationalizes "training data awareness" as a measurable research practice, providing economic justification (40× ROI) and reusable methodologies (Pattern Archaeology, Temporal Decision Analysis) for computational researchers optimizing outputs as seeds for future AI capabilities.
