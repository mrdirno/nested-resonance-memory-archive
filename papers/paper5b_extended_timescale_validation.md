## ABSTRACT (Draft)

**Background:** Complex adaptive systems may exhibit transient dynamics that appear stable over short timescales but eventually collapse, oscillate, or transform over extended durations. Most Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) experiments run 5,000 cycles (~1 hour runtime), raising questions about long-term pattern persistence and system stability.

**Methods:** We extended experimental timescales from baseline 5K cycles to 10K, 25K, 50K, and 100K cycles (20× increase) while holding other parameters constant (population=100, frequency=2.5 Hz, baseline configuration). Pattern mining tools from Paper 5D applied at multiple time windows to detect temporal evolution, pattern persistence, and potential regime shifts. Four timescales × 5 seeds = 20 experiments (total: ~8 hours runtime).

**Results:** [To be determined after experiments] Hypothesis: Patterns observed at 5K cycles persist through 100K cycles with minor fluctuations (temporal stability validated). Alternatively, long-term dynamics may reveal: (1) slow oscillations invisible at 5K timescale, (2) gradual pattern degradation, (3) late-emerging patterns requiring extended runtime, or (4) regime transitions after critical time threshold.

**Conclusions:** [To be determined] If patterns persist: Validates 5K-cycle experiments as representative of long-term behavior (efficiency justified). If patterns change: Identifies minimum timescale requirements for valid NRM characterization (methodology refinement needed).

**Keywords:** Temporal stability, long-term dynamics, extended timescale, pattern persistence, nested resonance memory, regime transitions

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 The Timescale Problem in Complex Systems

Complex adaptive systems exhibit dynamics across multiple timescales, from rapid micro-interactions to slow macro-evolution (Simon, 1962). A fundamental methodological question confronts computational modelers: how long must simulations run to capture "representative" system behavior? Run too briefly, and transient dynamics may masquerade as equilibrium states. Run too long, and computational costs become prohibitive without guaranteeing additional insight (Grimm & Railsback, 2005).

This timescale problem manifests across disciplines: ecological models may appear stable over years but collapse over decades (Hastings, 2004), evolutionary simulations exhibit punctuated equilibrium invisible at short timescales (Eldredge & Gould, 1972), and economic agent-based models show regime shifts after thousands of iterations (Arthur et al., 1997). The challenge intensifies for systems claiming "perpetual motion" or "non-equilibrium dynamics"—how do we distinguish genuinely sustained behavior from slowly-decaying transients?

### 1.2 Current Practice in Agent-Based Modeling

Most agent-based modeling (ABM) studies run simulations for durations chosen pragmatically rather than principled: long enough to observe "interesting" behavior, short enough to complete within computational budgets and researcher attention spans (Railsback & Grimm, 2019). Typical practices include:

**1. Arbitrary duration choices:** 1,000 iterations, 10,000 steps, or "until patterns stabilize" (subjectively determined)
**2. Equilibrium assumptions:** Run until metrics plateau, then stop (assumes equilibrium exists)
**3. Computational constraints:** Run as long as affordable (timescale dictated by resources, not theory)
**4. Replicate-over-duration tradeoff:** Prefer 100 seeds × 1,000 cycles over 10 seeds × 10,000 cycles (emphasizes statistical power over temporal depth)

Few studies systematically validate that chosen timescales capture representative dynamics (Ten Broeke et al., 2016). Extended timescale validation—rerunning key experiments at 2×, 5×, 10× longer durations—remains rare despite being methodologically essential for establishing temporal robustness.

### 1.3 NRM Framework and 5K-Cycle Baseline

Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) experiments (Papers 2-5D) have primarily used **5,000-cycle** duration as standard:

**Rationale for 5K cycles:**
- **Computational efficiency:** ~1 minute runtime per experiment (enables large-scale parameter sweeps)
- **Pattern stabilization:** Visual inspection suggests dynamics stabilize by ~2,000 cycles
- **Practical constraints:** Papers 2-4 collectively ran 300+ experiments (1,500,000 total cycles)
- **Precedent:** Similar timescales common in ABM literature

**However, this choice remains empirically unvalidated.** Critical questions persist:

**Q1: Transient vs. Sustained?** Do patterns observed at 5K cycles represent genuine long-term attractors, or are they transients preceding eventual collapse or transformation?

**Q2: Hidden Slow Dynamics?** Could long-term oscillations, regime shifts, or punctuated patterns exist with periods longer than 5K cycles?

**Q3: Late-Emerging Patterns?** Might some pattern types require extended runtime to develop (e.g., memory consolidation across many composition-decomposition cycles)?

**Q4: Computational Waste?** If 5K cycles prove sufficient, are researchers wasting time with longer runs? Conversely, if insufficient, are published results based on non-representative transients?

### 1.4 Research Question

**Primary:** Do NRM patterns observed at 5K cycles persist, transform, or collapse when extended to 10K, 25K, 50K, and 100K cycles?

**Sub-questions:**
1. Are pattern counts stable across timescales (consistent emergence)?
2. Are pattern stability scores stable across timescales (persistence)?
3. Do new pattern types emerge at extended timescales (late-emerging patterns)?
4. Do patterns degrade or strengthen over time (temporal evolution)?
5. Is 5K-cycle baseline adequate for representative NRM characterization?

### 1.5 Contributions

1. **First systematic timescale validation** for NRM framework (5K-100K cycles)
2. **Temporal stability characterization** of emergent patterns across 20× duration range
3. **Late-emerging pattern detection** identifying dynamics invisible at standard timescales
4. **Methodological validation** justifying (or refuting) 5K-cycle experimental standard
5. **Design guidelines** for minimum timescale requirements in NRM research

## 2. METHODS

### 2.1 Experimental Design

**Fixed Parameters:**
- Population: N = 100 agents (baseline)
- Frequency: f = 2.5 Hz (known stable regime from C171/C175)
- Configuration: Baseline (full NRM framework, all mechanisms enabled)
- Sampling: Every 100 cycles (constant resolution across timescales)

**Varied Parameters:**

#### 2.1.1 Timescales Tested

1. **5K cycles (Baseline):** Standard duration from Papers 2-5D
   - Runtime: ~1 minute per experiment
   - Snapshots: 50 samples

2. **10K cycles (2× extension):** Double baseline duration
   - Runtime: ~2 minutes per experiment
   - Snapshots: 100 samples
   - Purpose: Detect patterns with ~5K-10K period

3. **25K cycles (5× extension):** Medium-term validation
   - Runtime: ~5 minutes per experiment
   - Snapshots: 250 samples
   - Purpose: Capture multi-period dynamics

4. **50K cycles (10× extension):** Long-term validation
   - Runtime: ~10 minutes per experiment
   - Snapshots: 500 samples
   - Purpose: Test decade-scale stability

5. **100K cycles (20× extension):** Ultra-long validation
   - Runtime: ~20 minutes per experiment
   - Snapshots: 1000 samples
   - Purpose: Detect very slow dynamics or late collapse

**Replication:**
- Seeds: 5 replications per timescale (balance between statistical power and computational cost)
- Total: 4 timescales × 5 seeds = 20 experiments
- Total runtime: ~8 hours (can run overnight)

### 2.2 Pattern Detection Across Timescales

**Apply Paper 5D Pattern Mining Framework** at multiple time windows:

#### 2.2.1 Sliding Window Analysis

For each experiment, analyze patterns in consecutive windows:
- Window size: 5,000 cycles (constant)
- Stride: 2,500 cycles (50% overlap)
- Windows per timescale:
  - 5K: 1 window (cycles 0-5000)
  - 10K: 3 windows (0-5K, 2.5K-7.5K, 5K-10K)
  - 25K: 9 windows
  - 50K: 19 windows
  - 100K: 39 windows

**Metrics Computed Per Window:**
- Pattern count (how many patterns detected)
- Pattern stability scores (average across patterns)
- Pattern type distribution (temporal, memory, spatial, interaction)
- Population mean and variance
- Composition event frequency

**Temporal Evolution Analysis:**
- Plot metrics vs. time (across all windows)
- Detect trends (linear, oscillatory, exponential)
- Identify regime transitions (sudden metric changes)

#### 2.2.2 Full-Duration Pattern Detection

For each experiment, also analyze entire duration as single window:
- Detect patterns using full temporal data
- Compare to patterns detected in first 5K cycles only
- Identify late-emerging patterns (appear only with extended runtime)

### 2.3 Temporal Stability Metrics

#### 2.3.1 Pattern Persistence

For each pattern detected in first 5K cycles:
- **Persistence Score:** % of subsequent windows where pattern remains detectable
- High persistence (>80%): Pattern stable across timescales
- Medium persistence (40-80%): Pattern fluctuates but recurs
- Low persistence (<40%): Pattern transient (disappears after 5K)

#### 2.3.2 Metric Stability

For each outcome metric (pattern count, stability, population):
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV):** σ / μ across windows
- Low CV (<0.2): Metric stable across time
- High CV (>0.5): Metric fluctuates across time

#### 2.3.3 Trend Detection

For each metric time series:
- **Linear regression:** Slope and R² for trend detection
- Positive slope: Metric increasing over time (growth)
- Negative slope: Metric decreasing over time (degradation)
- Flat (|slope| < 0.01): Metric stable over time

## 3. RESULTS (Placeholder)

### 3.1 Pattern Count Stability Across Timescales

**Hypothesis:** Pattern count stable across timescales (5K-cycle observations representative)

**Expected Results:**

| Timescale | Pattern Count (Mean ± SD) | CV (%) | Trend (slope/1K cycles) |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| 5K cycles | 17 ± 1 | 5.9% | -0.02 (flat) |
| 10K cycles | 17 ± 1 | 6.2% | -0.01 (flat) |
| 25K cycles | 16 ± 1 | 7.5% | -0.03 (slight decline) |
| 50K cycles | 16 ± 2 | 9.1% | -0.04 (slight decline) |
| 100K cycles | 15 ± 2 | 11.3% | -0.05 (slight decline) |

**Interpretation:** If pattern count remains 15-17 across all timescales → **5K-cycle baseline validated** (representative). Slight decline over ultra-long timescales suggests minor pattern degradation but overall stability.

**Alternative Result (Pattern Collapse):**
- If pattern count drops sharply at extended timescales (e.g., 17 → 5 → 0) → **5K-cycle baseline insufficient** (transient dynamics, not sustained)
- Critical timescale: Minimum duration before collapse (e.g., t_collapse ≈ 15K cycles)

**Alternative Result (Late-Emerging Patterns):**
- If pattern count increases at extended timescales (e.g., 17 → 20 → 25) → **5K-cycle baseline misses late-emerging patterns**
- New pattern types require extended runtime to develop

### 3.2 Temporal Pattern Persistence

**Expected Results:**

| Pattern Type | Persistence Score (% Windows) | Interpretation |
|--------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| Temporal Steady State (15 patterns from 5K) | 92% ± 5% | Highly persistent |
| Memory Retention (2 patterns from 5K) | 87% ± 8% | Highly persistent |
| Spatial Patterns (0 from 5K) | N/A | None detected (consistent) |

**Interpretation:** If high persistence (>85%) → Patterns observed at 5K are genuine long-term attractors, not transients.

**Alternative Result (Low Persistence):**
- If persistence < 50% → Patterns detected at 5K are transients that disappear or transform
- 5K-cycle experiments capture unstable dynamics only

### 3.3 Population Dynamics Stability

**Expected Results:**

| Timescale | Mean Population | CV (%) | Final Population | Collapse Rate |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|------------------|---------------|
| 5K cycles | 18.5 ± 1.2 | 6.5% | 18.2 ± 1.8 | 0% |
| 10K cycles | 18.3 ± 1.4 | 7.6% | 17.9 ± 2.1 | 0% |
| 25K cycles | 18.0 ± 1.8 | 10.0% | 17.5 ± 2.5 | 0% |
| 50K cycles | 17.8 ± 2.1 | 11.8% | 17.0 ± 3.0 | 5% (1/20 runs) |
| 100K cycles | 17.5 ± 2.5 | 14.3% | 16.2 ± 3.8 | 10% (2/20 runs) |

**Interpretation:** If populations remain stable (15-20 agents) through 100K cycles → Long-term sustainability validated. Slight increase in variance over time expected (stochastic drift), but no catastrophic collapse.

**Alternative Result (Late Collapse):**
- If collapse rate increases sharply at extended timescales (e.g., 0% → 50% → 100%) → Energy balance eventually fails
- Critical timescale: t_collapse ≈ [VALUE]K cycles (late-stage resource exhaustion)

### 3.4 Slow Dynamics and Hidden Oscillations

**Hypothesis:** Long-period oscillations (>5K cycles) exist but invisible at standard timescale

**Analysis:** Spectral analysis (FFT) of population time series across timescales

**Expected Results:**

| Timescale | Dominant Frequency | Secondary Frequencies | Long-Period Component? |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 5K cycles | f ≈ 2.5 Hz (imposed) | None significant | Not detectable |
| 10K cycles | f ≈ 2.5 Hz | f ≈ 0.8 Hz? | Possible (~1250 cycle period) |
| 25K cycles | f ≈ 2.5 Hz | f ≈ 0.5 Hz? | Detectable (~2000 cycle period) |
| 50K cycles | f ≈ 2.5 Hz | f ≈ 0.2 Hz? | Clear (~5000 cycle period) |
| 100K cycles | f ≈ 2.5 Hz | f ≈ 0.1 Hz? | Strong (~10000 cycle period) |

**Interpretation:** If long-period oscillations detected → **Hidden slow dynamics exist** (5K-cycle baseline misses temporal complexity). System exhibits multi-timescale behavior.

**Alternative Result (No Hidden Dynamics):**
- If only imposed frequency (2.5 Hz) detected, no long-period components → 5K-cycle baseline captures all relevant dynamics

### 3.5 Late-Emerging Pattern Types

**Hypothesis:** Some pattern types require extended runtime to emerge (e.g., memory consolidation across many cycles)

**Analysis:** Compare patterns detected in first 5K cycles vs. full duration

**Expected Results:**

| Pattern Type | Detected at 5K | Detected at 100K | Late-Emerging? |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Temporal Steady State | 15 patterns | 15 patterns | No (immediate) |
| Memory Retention | 2 patterns | 2 patterns | No (immediate) |
| Memory Transfer | 0 patterns | 0 patterns | No |
| Long-Period Oscillation | 0 patterns | 3 patterns? | YES (requires >25K cycles) |
| Hysteresis | 0 patterns | 1 pattern? | YES (requires >50K cycles) |

**Interpretation:** If new pattern types emerge only at extended timescales → **5K-cycle baseline insufficient for complete pattern catalog** (misses rare/slow patterns).

**Alternative Result (No Late Patterns):**
- If pattern catalog identical at 5K vs. 100K → 5K-cycle baseline sufficient (no hidden pattern types)

## 4. DISCUSSION (Placeholder)

### 4.1 Validation of 5K-Cycle Experimental Standard

**If patterns stable across all timescales:**
- ✅ 5K-cycle baseline validated as representative of long-term behavior
- ✅ Computational efficiency justified (no need for routine extended runs)
- ✅ Published results from Papers 2-5D remain valid (not artifacts of short timescales)
- ✅ Design recommendation: Continue using 5K cycles for routine experiments

**If patterns change at extended timescales:**
- ⚠️ 5K-cycle baseline inadequate for capturing NRM dynamics
- ⚠️ Published results may reflect transients, not sustained behavior
- ⚠️ Minimum timescale requirements identified (e.g., "use ≥25K cycles for valid characterization")
- ⚠️ Design recommendation: Extend standard duration to [VALUE]K cycles

### 4.2 Transient vs. Sustained Dynamics

**If high pattern persistence (>85%):**
- Patterns observed at 5K cycles are **genuine long-term attractors**
- NRM exhibits sustained dynamics, not just transient phenomena
- Validates theoretical claim of "perpetual motion" (no eventual equilibrium)

**If low pattern persistence (<50%):**
- Patterns are **transient structures** that eventually disappear
- NRM may settle into equilibrium or alternative states over long timescales
- Requires theory refinement (what determines pattern lifetime?)

### 4.3 Hidden Slow Dynamics

**If long-period oscillations detected:**
- NRM exhibits **multi-timescale behavior** (fast composition cycles + slow population oscillations)
- Enriches theoretical model (must account for slow modes in addition to fast dynamics)
- Practical implication: Monitor systems over extended periods to detect slow instabilities

**If no hidden dynamics:**
- Fast timescale (2.5 Hz) dominates all system behavior
- Single-timescale models sufficient for NRM characterization
- Simplified analysis possible

### 4.4 Computational Budget vs. Temporal Depth Tradeoff

**Research Design Question:** Given fixed computational budget, should we prioritize:
- **Option A:** Many seeds × short duration (e.g., 100 seeds × 5K cycles = 500K total cycles)
- **Option B:** Few seeds × long duration (e.g., 10 seeds × 50K cycles = 500K total cycles)

**If timescale insensitive (patterns stable):**
- **Prefer Option A** (many seeds) - emphasize statistical power over temporal depth
- Short runs capture representative behavior, replication more valuable

**If timescale sensitive (patterns change):**
- **Prefer Option B** (long duration) - must capture long-term dynamics
- Extended runs essential, statistical power secondary concern

**Hybrid Strategy:** Use extended runs for initial validation, then switch to shorter runs with many seeds once timescale adequacy confirmed.

## 5. CONCLUSIONS (Placeholder)

### Key Findings (Expected):
1. **Pattern count stable across timescales** (15-17 patterns persist through 100K cycles)
2. **High pattern persistence** (>85% of 5K patterns remain detectable at 100K)
3. **Population stability maintained** (17-19 agents sustained across all timescales)
4. **No critical late-emerging patterns** (5K-cycle baseline captures pattern catalog)
5. **5K-cycle experimental standard validated** (representative of long-term behavior)

### Contributions:
- First systematic timescale validation for NRM framework
- Temporal stability characterization across 20× duration range
- Methodological validation of 5K-cycle baseline
- Design guidelines for minimum timescale requirements

### Future Work:
- Even longer timescales (1M cycles) to test absolute limits
- Timescale sensitivity across different parameter regimes (do results hold at f=1.5 Hz?)
- Comparison with other ABM frameworks (is 5K-cycle adequacy universal or NRM-specific?)
- Adaptive timescale selection (when to extend vs. stop experiments)

**Overall:** Extended timescale validation confirms (or refutes) that standard 5K-cycle experiments capture representative NRM dynamics, providing essential methodological foundation for all NRM research. If validated, justifies computational efficiency of current approach. If refuted, identifies minimum timescale requirements for valid characterization.
