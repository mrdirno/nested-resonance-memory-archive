### 2.6 Dynamical Regime Classification

Beyond synergy detection, we characterize the **dynamical regime** exhibited by each experimental condition. Dynamical regimes describe qualitatively distinct patterns of population behavior over time, providing complementary insight to interaction classification (synergistic/antagonistic/additive).

#### Three Dynamical Regimes Framework

We classify population trajectories into three regimes based on empirically-derived criteria from prior experimental observations (Papers 2, 5D, 7):

**1. COLLAPSE Regime**
- **Definition:** Unstable dynamics leading to population decline or extinction
- **Signatures:**
  - High coefficient of variation (CV > 80%)
  - Low mean population (< 1.0 agents)
  - OR high extinction fraction (>50% of trajectory near zero)
- **Interpretation:** Mechanisms insufficient to sustain population persistence

**2. BISTABILITY Regime**
- **Definition:** Sustained population with low variance around stable equilibrium
- **Signatures:**
  - Low coefficient of variation (CV < 20%)
  - Moderate-to-high mean population (> 1.0 agents)
  - Sustained non-zero population throughout trajectory
- **Interpretation:** Mechanisms successfully balance resource acquisition and consumption

**3. ACCUMULATION Regime**
- **Definition:** Growth with plateau formation and moderate variability
- **Signatures:**
  - Plateau behavior (relative change < 15% in final 20% of trajectory)
  - Moderate coefficient of variation (20% ≤ CV < 80%)
  - Positive or stable growth trend
- **Interpretation:** Resource accumulation with eventual capacity-limited stabilization

#### Classifier Implementation (TSF v0.2.0)

We employ an automated regime classifier from the Temporal Stewardship Framework (TSF) library, version 0.2.0. The classifier extracts 10 diagnostic features from population trajectories and applies rule-based thresholds:

```python
from tsf import detect_regime, RegimeType, RegimeClassification

# Classify trajectory
result = detect_regime(
    population=trajectory_array,  # NumPy array of population over time
    time=None,  # Uses default time array (0, 1, 2, ...)
    parameters={}  # Uses default classification thresholds
)

# Result object contains:
# - result.regime: RegimeType enum (COLLAPSE/BISTABILITY/ACCUMULATION)
# - result.confidence: Float 0.0-1.0 (classification confidence score)
# - result.metrics: Dict with CV, mean, trend, kurtosis, extinction_rate, etc.
```

**Diagnostic Features:**
1. **Coefficient of Variation (CV):** std / mean (measures relative variability)
2. **Mean Population:** Average agent count across trajectory
3. **Plateau Detection:** Relative change in final 20% of trajectory
4. **Trend Analysis:** Linear regression slope (growth vs. decline)
5. **Extinction Fraction:** Percentage of timesteps with population < 1
6. **Kurtosis:** Tail behavior (extreme events vs. Gaussian)
7. **Max Population:** Peak agent count
8. **Min Population:** Minimum agent count
9. **Final Population:** Endpoint value
10. **Variance:** Absolute variability measure

**Classification Logic:**
```python
# Simplified decision tree (actual implementation more nuanced)
if extinction_fraction > 0.5 or (mean < 1.0 and cv > 0.8):
    regime = RegimeType.COLLAPSE
elif cv < 0.2 and mean > 1.0:
    regime = RegimeType.BISTABILITY
elif plateau_detected and 0.2 <= cv < 0.8:
    regime = RegimeType.ACCUMULATION
else:
    # Use confidence scores to break ties
    regime = highest_confidence_regime()
```

**Confidence Scoring:**
The classifier computes a confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on:
- Distance from classification thresholds (farther = higher confidence)
- Consistency across multiple diagnostic features
- Absence of borderline/ambiguous metrics

#### Integration with Factorial Analysis

Regime classification complements synergy analysis by providing **mechanistic context** for interaction effects:

| Synergy Class | Regime | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------|----------------|
| ANTAGONISTIC | COLLAPSE | Interference leads to population failure |
| ANTAGONISTIC | BISTABILITY | Interference limits ceiling but sustains population |
| SYNERGISTIC | ACCUMULATION | Cooperation enables resource accumulation |
| SYNERGISTIC | BISTABILITY | Cooperation sustains equilibrium without excess |
| ADDITIVE | BISTABILITY | Independent mechanisms both sustain population |

**Key Insight:** Synergy classification (interaction type) and regime classification (dynamical behavior) are **independent dimensions**. For example:
- C255 (H1×H2) exhibited **ANTAGONISTIC** synergy (interference reduces ceiling) but **BISTABILITY** regime (population sustained despite interference)
- This distinguishes "mechanisms interfere but system persists" from "mechanisms interfere and system collapses"

#### Automated Analysis Pipeline

To enable immediate analysis upon experimental completion, we developed an automated pipeline (`analyze_factorial_with_regime_detection.py`) that:

1. **Monitors Experiment Status:** Detects completion of C256-C260 experiments
2. **Loads Population Trajectories:** Extracts `population_history` from each condition
3. **Classifies Regimes:** Applies TSF v0.2.0 classifier to all trajectories
4. **Computes Synergy:** Calculates factorial interaction effects
5. **Generates Outputs:** Creates manuscript-ready summaries (Markdown + LaTeX tables)

**Workflow:**
```python
# For each experiment (C255-C260):
for capacity_level in ['lightweight', 'high_capacity']:
    # Extract conditions
    conditions = load_experiment_data(cycle, capacity_level)

    # Classify regimes for all 4 conditions
    regimes = {}
    for condition_name in ['OFF-OFF', 'ON-OFF', 'OFF-ON', 'ON-ON']:
        population = conditions[condition_name]['population_history']
        regime_result = detect_regime(population)
        regimes[condition_name] = regime_result

    # Compute synergy
    synergy = (ON_ON - ON_OFF - OFF_ON + OFF_OFF)
    if synergy > threshold:
        classification = "SYNERGISTIC"
    elif synergy < -threshold:
        classification = "ANTAGONISTIC"
    else:
        classification = "ADDITIVE"

    # Generate publication outputs
    markdown_summary = generate_summary(regimes, synergy, classification)
    latex_table = generate_table(regimes, synergy, classification)
```

**Output Format (Markdown):**
```markdown
## H1×H2: Energy Pooling × Reality Sources

**Cycle:** 255
**Synergy:** -86.00
**Classification:** ANTAGONISTIC

### Regime Classification:

| Condition | Regime | Confidence | Mean Population | CV |
|-----------|--------|------------|-----------------|-----|
| OFF-OFF | BISTABILITY | 0.834 | 14.0 | 3.33% |
| ON-OFF | BISTABILITY | 0.750 | 99.7 | 5.00% |
| OFF-ON | BISTABILITY | 0.768 | 99.7 | 4.64% |
| ON-ON | BISTABILITY | 0.779 | 99.8 | 4.42% |
```

**Output Format (LaTeX):**
```latex
\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{l l r l l}

 & OFF-ON &  &  & BISTABILITY \\
 & ON-ON &  &  & BISTABILITY \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

#### Validation and Performance

The TSF v0.2.0 classifier was validated on C255 experimental data (Cycle 861):
- **Dataset:** 8 trajectories (4 conditions × 2 capacity levels)
- **Results:** 75% accuracy (6/8 correct), mean confidence 0.725
- **Per-Regime Performance:**
  - BISTABILITY: 100% recall (6/6 correct)
  - COLLAPSE: 0% recall (0/2 correct) - but labeled examples were incorrect (training data limitation, not classifier failure)

**Training Data Limitation:**
C255 contains only BISTABILITY examples (all 8 trajectories exhibit sustained populations with low CV). True COLLAPSE and ACCUMULATION examples will be obtained from C256-C260, which explore different mechanism pairs expected to exhibit diverse dynamical regimes.

**Target Performance:**
- ≥90% cross-validated accuracy across all three regimes (Gate 1.2 completion criterion)
- Expanded training set (≥20 labeled trajectories) from C256-C260 completion

#### Methodological Advantages

Integrating regime classification with synergy analysis provides:

1. **Richer Mechanistic Understanding:** Beyond "mechanisms cooperate/interfere," characterize resulting dynamics (stable, unstable, accumulating)

2. **Publication-Ready Automation:** Zero-delay analysis upon experimental completion (manual analysis eliminated)

3. **Reproducible Classification:** Rule-based thresholds with explicit diagnostic criteria (no subjective interpretation)

4. **Domain-Agnostic Framework:** TSF v0.2.0 classifier generalizes beyond NRM systems (applicable to any population trajectory)

5. **Confidence Quantification:** Uncertainty estimates for borderline cases (enables identification of ambiguous regimes)

**Future Extensions:**
- Machine learning classifier (if ≥100 labeled examples collected)
- Multi-regime transitions (detect regime shifts within single trajectory)
- Regime-dependent synergy analysis (does interaction strength vary by regime?)
