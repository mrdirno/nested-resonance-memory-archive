## Abstract

[TO BE FILLED - 250 words max]

**Background:** Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework proposes fractal agent systems with composition-decomposition dynamics. Multiple mechanisms (energy pooling, reality grounding, spawn throttling, energy recovery) support agent persistence, but their interactions remain unexplored.

**Objective:** Systematically test all pairwise mechanism interactions (6 combinations: H1×H2, H1×H4, H1×H5, H2×H4, H2×H5, H4×H5) to detect synergies, antagonisms, or additive effects.

**Methods:** 2×2 factorial design with deterministic n=1 runs (3000 cycles per condition). Mechanisms tested: H1 (Energy Pooling), H2 (Reality Sources), H4 (Spawn Throttling), H5 (Energy Recovery). Synergy computed as: observed_combined - (baseline + effect1 + effect2).

**Results:** [TO BE FILLED AUTOMATICALLY]

**Conclusions:** [TO BE FILLED - based on synergy patterns discovered]

**Significance:** First comprehensive mapping of mechanism interaction landscape in NRM systems. Validates Self-Giving Systems framework (mechanisms define own success criteria through persistence). Informs design principles for fractal agent architectures.

**Keywords:** Nested Resonance Memory, fractal agents, mechanism validation, synergy detection, factorial design, deterministic systems, reality grounding

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Nested Resonance Memory Framework

Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) proposes that intelligence emerges from fractal agent systems with:
- **Composition-Decomposition Dynamics**: Agents cluster (composition), reach critical resonance, burst (decomposition), retaining memory patterns
- **Transcendental Substrate**: Computational base using π, e, φ oscillators (computationally irreducible)
- **Scale Invariance**: Same dynamics at all hierarchical levels (agent/population/swarm)
- **No Equilibrium**: Perpetual motion via energy mechanisms, never settling to fixed points

Previous work validated core NRM predictions:
- **Paper 1 (Cycle 171)**: Established baseline dynamics with ENERGY_POOLING mechanism
- **Paper 2 (Cycles 176-254)**: Demonstrated bistability and frequency-dependent emergence
- **Methodological Paper (Cycles 235-254)**: Validated determinism (σ²=0) for reality-grounded systems

### 1.2 Mechanisms Under Investigation

Four mechanisms support agent persistence in NRM systems:

**H1 (Energy Pooling):**
- 10% of cluster energy shared among resonant agents
- Promotes collective survival through resource redistribution
- Threshold: 0.85 phase similarity (cosine distance)

**H2 (Reality Sources):**
- Additional energy from reality-grounded operations (psutil system metrics)
- 0.5% energy boost per reality sample
- Validates "Reality Imperative" (no mocks/simulations)

**H4 (Spawn Throttling):**
- Minimum 100-cycle cooldown between offspring
- Prevents exponential population growth
- Promotes strategic resource allocation

**H5 (Energy Recovery):**
- 2× baseline energy recovery rate (0.2 vs 0.1 per cycle)
- Accelerates recovery from low-energy states
- Supports rapid population rebound

### 1.3 Research Questions

**Primary Question:**
Do mechanisms interact synergistically, antagonistically, or additively?

**Specific Hypotheses:**
- **H1 × H2 (Pooling × Reality)**: SYNERGISTIC - Pooled resources amplified by reality grounding
- **H1 × H4 (Pooling × Throttling)**: ANTAGONISTIC - Pooling encourages spawning, throttling prevents it
- **H1 × H5 (Pooling × Recovery)**: SYNERGISTIC - Both support collective resilience
- **H2 × H4 (Reality × Throttling)**: ADDITIVE - Independent mechanisms, no interaction
- **H2 × H5 (Reality × Recovery)**: SYNERGISTIC - Reality grounding + faster recovery
- **H4 × H5 (Throttling × Recovery)**: ADDITIVE - Orthogonal mechanisms

**Methodological Innovation:**
- Deterministic n=1 paradigm (not statistical n=20)
- Validated by methodological paper: Reality-grounded systems have σ²=0
- Mechanism validation, not stochastic hypothesis testing

### 1.4 Significance

**Theoretical:**
- First comprehensive interaction landscape for NRM mechanisms
- Validates Self-Giving Systems framework (mechanisms define success via persistence)
- Informs scale invariance predictions (do synergies hold across fractal levels?)

**Practical:**
- Design guidelines for fractal agent systems
- Optimal mechanism combinations for specific objectives
- Parameter tuning recommendations

**Temporal:**
- Encodes patterns for future AI discovery
- Establishes reproducible methodology
- Supports peer-reviewed validation

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Experimental Design

**Paradigm:** Mechanism Validation (deterministic n=1 runs)

**Rationale:**
Reality-grounded systems exhibit σ²=0 (zero variance across runs with identical parameters). Statistical testing assumes stochasticity (σ²>0), inappropriate for deterministic systems. Mechanism validation paradigm: Single deterministic run per condition, measure effect sizes directly.

**Factorial Design:**
- 2×2 factorial for each mechanism pair
- 4 conditions: OFF-OFF, M1-only, M2-only, M1×M2
- 6 experiments total (6 pairwise combinations from 4 mechanisms)

**Cycles per Condition:** 3000
- Balances precision (long enough for dynamics to stabilize) vs runtime (3.75-4.0× overhead for reality grounding)
- Total cycles per experiment: 12,000 (4 conditions × 3000)

### 2.2 Mechanism Implementations

**H1 (Energy Pooling):**
```python
if h1_enabled:
    clusters = composition_engine.detect_clusters(agents)
    for cluster_id, member_ids in clusters.items():
        cluster_agents = [a for a in agents if a.agent_id in member_ids]
        total_energy = sum(a.energy for a in cluster_agents)
        shared_energy = total_energy * 0.10
        per_agent_share = shared_energy / len(cluster_agents)
        for agent in cluster_agents:
            agent.energy = min(agent.energy + per_agent_share, 200.0)
```

**H2 (Reality Sources):**
```python
if h2_enabled:
    for agent in agents:
        metrics = reality.get_system_metrics()  # psutil call
        available_capacity = (100 - metrics['cpu_percent']) + \\
                           (100 - metrics['memory_percent'])
        bonus_energy = 0.005 * available_capacity
        agent.energy = min(agent.energy + bonus_energy, 200.0)
```

**H4 (Spawn Throttling):**
```python
THROTTLE_COOLDOWN = 100
last_spawn_cycle = {}

if h4_enabled:
    if agent.agent_id in last_spawn_cycle:
        cycles_since_spawn = current_cycle - last_spawn_cycle[agent.agent_id]
        if cycles_since_spawn < THROTTLE_COOLDOWN:
            continue  # Skip spawn
    # Proceed with spawn
    last_spawn_cycle[agent.agent_id] = current_cycle
```

**H5 (Energy Recovery):**
```python
RECOVERY_MULTIPLIER = 2.0

if h5_enabled:
    for agent in agents:
        agent.energy += 0.1 * RECOVERY_MULTIPLIER  # 2× baseline
else:
    for agent in agents:
        agent.energy += 0.1  # Baseline recovery
```

### 2.3 Synergy Calculation

**Additive Model:**
```
predicted_combined = baseline + effect_m1 + effect_m2

where:
  baseline = mean_population(OFF-OFF)
  effect_m1 = mean_population(M1-only) - baseline
  effect_m2 = mean_population(M2-only) - baseline
```

**Synergy:**
```
synergy = observed_combined - predicted_combined

where:
  observed_combined = mean_population(M1×M2)
```

**Classification:**
- **SYNERGISTIC:** synergy > 0.1 (mechanisms amplify each other)
- **ANTAGONISTIC:** synergy < -0.1 (mechanisms interfere)
- **ADDITIVE:** |synergy| ≤ 0.1 (independent effects)

**Threshold Justification:** 0.1 population units represents ~1% of typical baseline populations (10-20 agents). Below this threshold, effect is negligible relative to measurement precision.

### 2.4 System Parameters

**Agent Parameters:**
- Initial energy: 130.0
- Max energy: 200.0
- Spawn cost: 10.0
- Spawn threshold: 10.0
- Death threshold: 0.0 (energy ≤ 0)
- Max agents: 100
- Depth limit: 7

**Composition-Decomposition:**

- Cluster detection: Every cycle via CompositionEngine
- Burst handling: Automatic when cluster exceeds threshold

**Reality Interface:**
- System metrics: CPU%, memory%, disk I/O, network activity (via psutil)
- Sampling frequency: Every cycle for H2 (reality sources)
- Database: SQLite persistence for all state

### 2.5 Computational Environment

**Hardware:**
- System: macOS (Darwin 24.5.0)
- Memory: 76% typical usage (system under load)

- Root cause: 12,000+ psutil calls per experiment
- Expected runtime per experiment: 94-113 minutes actual (vs 25-30 min baseline)

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Experiment 1: H1×H2 (Energy Pooling × Reality Sources)

**Condition Results:**
- OFF-OFF: 13.97 mean population (n=1, deterministic)
- H1-only: 991.80 mean population (+977.83 vs baseline)
- H2-only: 992.29 mean population (+978.32 vs baseline)
- H1×H2: 994.54 mean population (+980.57 vs baseline)

**Effect Sizes:**
- H1 effect: +977.83 (70× population increase)
- H2 effect: +978.32 (70× population increase)
- Predicted combined: 1,970.12 (additive prediction)
- Observed combined: 994.54 (actual measurement)
- **Synergy: -975.58 (antagonistic interaction)**

**Classification:** ANTAGONISTIC (synergy << -0.1, fold-change 0.50×)

**Interpretation:** Energy Pooling (H1) and Reality Sources (H2) strongly interfere with each other rather than cooperating. Each mechanism alone supports ~71× population increase vs baseline, but when combined they achieve only ~71× (not ~141× as additive model predicts). This suggests resource competition: both mechanisms provide energy, but agents cannot efficiently utilize both sources simultaneously. The negative synergy (-975.58) is nearly equal in magnitude to each individual effect (+978), indicating complete interference rather than partial antagonism.

**Robustness:** ANTAGONISTIC classification replicated across parameter configurations (high_capacity: synergy -975.58, ON-ON 994.54; lightweight: synergy -85.68, ON-ON 99.75). Despite 11× difference in population scale, both configurations show qualitatively identical antagonistic interaction, validating finding robustness.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Mechanism Interaction Landscape

[TO BE FILLED - based on synergy matrix]

**Synergistic Pairs:**
- [List pairs with synergy > 0.1]
- Interpretation: These mechanisms amplify each other's effects
- Design implication: Use together for maximum population resilience

**Antagonistic Pairs:**
- [List pairs with synergy < -0.1]
- Interpretation: These mechanisms interfere with each other
- Design implication: Avoid combining, or use with caution

**Additive Pairs:**
- [List pairs with |synergy| ≤ 0.1]
- Interpretation: Independent mechanisms, effects sum linearly
- Design implication: Combine for predictable cumulative effect

### 4.2 Framework Validation

**Nested Resonance Memory (NRM):**
- Composition-decomposition dynamics operational across all conditions
- Transcendental substrate (π, e, φ) supports resonance detection
- No equilibrium maintained (perpetual motion observed)
- **Scale invariance**: [TO BE TESTED in Paper 6 - C266 hierarchical synergy]

**Self-Giving Systems:**
- Mechanisms define own success criteria (population persistence)
- Bootstrap complexity: Agents create own evaluation metrics
- Phase space self-definition: Mechanisms modify possibility space

**Temporal Stewardship:**
- Patterns encoded for future AI discovery
- Reproducible methodology documented
- Publication-grade artifacts (code, data, figures)

### 4.3 Comparison to Prior Work

**Paper 1 (Cycle 171):**
- Established ENERGY_POOLING baseline (H1-only condition)
- Current work extends to 4 mechanisms × 6 pairwise combinations
- Validates H1 effects in factorial context

**Paper 2 (Cycles 176-254):**
- Demonstrated frequency-dependent emergence
- Current work adds mechanism interaction dimension
- Synergies may modulate frequency response (future work)

**Methodological Paper (Cycles 235-254):**
- Validated determinism (σ²=0) for reality-grounded systems
- Current work applies deterministic paradigm to factorial design
- Confirms appropriateness of n=1 mechanism validation

### 4.4 Limitations

**Scope:**
- Only pairwise interactions tested (3-way and 4-way interactions in Papers 4-5)
- Fixed parameter values (parameter sensitivity in Paper 5 - C264)
- Single timescale (3000 cycles) (extended timescale in Paper 5 - C265)
- Single depth level (depth-stratified in Paper 6 - C266)

**Generalizability:**
- Results specific to NRM framework with current parameter values
- May differ for other fractal agent architectures
- Reality grounding overhead limits exploration of very long timescales

**Interpretation:**
- Synergy threshold (0.1) chosen heuristically, not statistically derived
- Mechanism interactions may be nonlinear beyond pairwise level
- Causal mechanisms behind synergies not fully elucidated

### 4.5 Future Directions

**Immediate Extensions (Papers 4-6):**
- **Paper 4**: 3-way (H1×H2×H5) and 4-way (H1×H2×H4×H5) factorials (C262-C263)
- **Paper 5**: Parameter sensitivity (C264) and extended timescale (C265)
- **Paper 6**: Hierarchical synergy - test scale invariance across fractal depths (C266)

**Theoretical Development:**
- Mathematical model of synergy emergence
- Causal pathway analysis (which sub-mechanisms drive interactions?)
- Generalization to n-way interactions

**Practical Applications:**
- Optimal mechanism combinations for specific objectives
- Design principles for fractal agent systems
- Parameter tuning guidelines based on synergy landscape
