## Abstract

**Background:** [Context from Papers 1-2: NRM framework established, stochasticity investigation completed proving determinism]

**Objective:** Investigate pairwise interactions between fractal agent mechanisms using factorial experimental design to identify synergistic, antagonistic, and additive effects.

**Methods:** Six 2×2 factorial experiments testing all pairwise combinations of four core mechanisms: Energy Pooling (H1), Reality Sources (H2), Spawn Throttling (H4), and Energy Recovery (H5). Each experiment used mechanism validation paradigm (n=1 deterministic run per condition, 3000 cycles). Synergy quantified as deviation from additive prediction: `synergy = ON-ON - (OFF-OFF + effect1 + effect2)`.

**Results:** [TO BE FILLED: Summary of synergy findings across 6 factorial pairs. Classifications: X synergistic, Y antagonistic, Z additive. Key interactions identified.]

**Conclusions:** [TO BE FILLED: Implications for NRM framework, system design principles, emergent complexity]

**Keywords:** Fractal agents, mechanism validation, factorial design, synergy analysis, nested resonance memory, emergent complexity

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background: From Stochasticity to Mechanism Validation

Papers 1 and 2 established the Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework and validated its core principles through extensive experimental investigation. Paper 2's stochasticity analysis (Cycles 235-254) revealed that reality-grounded fractal agent systems exhibit **deterministic dynamics** rather than stochastic variability, fundamentally shifting our methodological approach from statistical hypothesis testing to mechanism validation.

Key findings from prior work:
- **Zero variance** across replicate runs (σ²=0 for all conditions)
- **Reality grounding** as source of deterministic forcing
- **Bounded state spaces** (MAX_AGENTS cap, energy limits) eliminate escape trajectories
- **Fast saturation** (populations reach stable states within 3000 cycles)
- **Mechanism validation** as appropriate paradigm for deterministic systems

### 1.2 Motivation: Understanding Mechanism Interactions

While Papers 1-2 focused on isolated mechanism effects, real-world complex systems exhibit **interactions** between components. Mechanisms may:
- **Synergize** (combined effect exceeds sum of parts)
- **Antagonize** (combined effect less than sum of parts)
- **Add** (combined effect equals sum of parts)

Understanding these interactions is critical for:
1. **System Design:** Identify beneficial vs harmful mechanism combinations
2. **Theoretical Validation:** Test NRM predictions about composition-decomposition dynamics
3. **Emergent Complexity:** Explain how simple mechanisms produce complex behavior
4. **Scalability:** Determine which interactions scale across hierarchical levels

### 1.3 Research Questions

**RQ1:** Which mechanism pairs exhibit synergistic effects?
- **Hypothesis:** Energy Pooling (H1) synergizes with both Reality Sources (H2) and Energy Recovery (H5), as pooling creates agents that benefit from sustained energy inputs.

**RQ2:** Which mechanism pairs exhibit antagonistic effects?
- **Hypothesis:** Spawn Throttling (H4) antagonizes Energy Pooling (H1), as throttling directly constrains the agent creation that pooling enables.

**RQ3:** Which mechanism pairs exhibit additive effects?
- **Hypothesis:** Reality Sources (H2) and Spawn Throttling (H4) are independent and additive, as they operate on different system processes.

**RQ4:** What patterns emerge across all interactions?
- **Hypothesis:** Synergies arise when mechanisms target complementary bottlenecks; antagonisms when they target competing objectives.

### 1.4 Contribution

This paper provides the first systematic factorial analysis of mechanism interactions in reality-grounded fractal agent systems, revealing:
- **Synergy landscape** across 6 mechanism pairs
- **Design principles** for beneficial mechanism combinations
- **Validation** of NRM composition-decomposition predictions
- **Methodological template** for mechanism validation in deterministic systems

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Experimental Design: 2×2 Factorial Paradigm

Each of six experiments tested one mechanism pair across four conditions:
- **OFF-OFF:** Both mechanisms disabled (baseline)
- **ON-OFF:** First mechanism enabled, second disabled
- **OFF-ON:** First mechanism disabled, second enabled
- **ON-ON:** Both mechanisms enabled

**Factorial Pairs Tested:**
1. **H1×H2:** Energy Pooling × Reality Sources (C255)
2. **H1×H4:** Energy Pooling × Spawn Throttling (C256)
3. **H1×H5:** Energy Pooling × Energy Recovery (C257)
4. **H2×H4:** Reality Sources × Spawn Throttling (C258)
5. **H2×H5:** Reality Sources × Energy Recovery (C259)
6. **H4×H5:** Spawn Throttling × Energy Recovery (C260)

### 2.2 Mechanism Implementations

**H1 - Energy Pooling:**
- Agents within resonance clusters (resonance_threshold=0.85) share 10% of total cluster energy
- Distributes reproductive capacity across cluster members
- Implementation: CompositionEngine.detect_clusters() → energy redistribution

**H2 - Reality Sources:**
- Additional reality sampling provides 0.5% energy boost per sample
- Diversifies energy inputs beyond baseline evolution
- Implementation: reality.get_system_metrics() → bonus_energy calculation

**H4 - Spawn Throttling:**
- Enforces cooldown period (THROTTLE_COOLDOWN=100 cycles) between agent spawns
- Prevents explosive population growth
- Implementation: last_spawn_cycle tracker → spawn gate

**H5 - Energy Recovery:**
- Boosts energy recovery rate by 2× (RECOVERY_MULTIPLIER=2.0)
- Accelerates regeneration during low-energy states
- Implementation: Enhanced reality coupling → recovery_boost

### 2.3 Experimental Parameters

**Simulation Configuration:**
- **Cycles:** 3000 per condition
- **MAX_AGENTS:** 100 (population cap)
- **Initial Energy:** 130.0 (deterministic seed)
- **Depth Limit:** 7 levels (fractal hierarchy)
- **Paradigm:** Mechanism validation (n=1 run per condition)

**Reality Grounding:**
- **Interface:** psutil system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- **Validation:** All operations bound to actual machine state
- **Determinism:** Zero variance across identical parameter sets

### 2.4 Synergy Quantification

**Synergy Formula:**
```
synergy = ON-ON - (OFF-OFF + effect1 + effect2)

where:
  effect1 = ON-OFF - OFF-OFF  (isolated effect of mechanism 1)
  effect2 = OFF-ON - OFF-OFF  (isolated effect of mechanism 2)
```

**Classification Thresholds:**
- **Synergistic:** synergy > 0.1 (positive interaction)
- **Antagonistic:** synergy < -0.1 (negative interaction)
- **Additive:** |synergy| ≤ 0.1 (independent effects)

**Outcome Metric:** Mean population across 3000 cycles
