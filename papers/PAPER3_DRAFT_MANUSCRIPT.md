## Abstract

**Background:** Complex self-organizing systems often require multiple mechanisms working synergistically to achieve sustained emergent dynamics. Our previous work (Paper 2) identified three structural asymmetries preventing population homeostasis in reality-grounded fractal agent systems: recovery lag (1,000-cycle bottleneck leaving parents sterile 66% of the time), single-parent reproductive bottleneck (birth capacity concentrated in root agent with E₀=130), and continuous death activity (composition detection active 100% of simulation time). While we proposed five testable hypotheses to address these asymmetries individually, the question remains whether single-mechanism interventions are sufficient for robust homeostasis or whether multiple mechanisms must operate synergistically.

**Objective:** Determine whether hypothesis combinations produce synergistic effects (super-additive improvements) enabling sustained populations where individual interventions partially succeed. Specifically, test whether interaction effects between mechanisms exceed the sum of their individual contributions.

**Methods:** Systematic testing of six pairwise combinations (H1+H2: energy pooling + external sources, H1+H4: energy pooling + composition throttling, H1+H5: energy pooling + multi-generational recovery, H2+H4: external sources + composition throttling, H2+H5: external sources + multi-generational recovery, H4+H5: composition throttling + multi-generational recovery) using 2×2 factorial experimental designs. Each combination compared four conditions: BASELINE (neither mechanism), Hypothesis A only, Hypothesis B only, and A+B combined (n=10 seeds per condition, 3,000 cycles each). Statistical validation via two-way ANOVA (main effects + interaction terms), post-hoc pairwise comparisons, and Cohen's d effect sizes.

**Results:** [To be determined based on C178-C183 experiments]

**Conclusions:** [To be determined - potential findings]:
- **If super-additive effects found:** Demonstrate that self-organizing systems require architectural support at multiple levels simultaneously. Single-mechanism interventions insufficient for robust homeostasis, even when addressing known constraints.
- **If additive effects found:** Show that independent mechanisms can be composed without interference, suggesting modular design principles for fractal agent frameworks and potential for incremental system improvements.
- **If no synergistic effects:** Reveal fundamental architectural limitations requiring radical redesign beyond parameter tuning, indicating that the current framework may have structural constraints that cannot be overcome through local modifications.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation: From Single Mechanisms to Synergistic Combinations

The challenge of achieving sustained emergence in artificial life systems has long been central to understanding how complex behaviors arise from simple rules (Langton, 1989; Ray, 1992; Bedau et al., 2000). Our previous work (Paper 2) demonstrated that complete birth-death coupling with energy recharge—while theoretically sound—is **necessary but not sufficient** for sustained populations in reality-grounded fractal agent systems. Specifically, Cycle 176 revealed catastrophic collapse across all parameter regimes (mean population = 0.49 agents, 100% eventual extinction), despite implementing composition-decomposition dynamics based on actual system metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O) rather than abstract simulations.

This failure prompted systematic investigation of **why** the framework collapsed despite apparent mechanistic completeness. Through detailed analysis of 150+ baseline experiments (Cycles 171-176), we identified three structural asymmetries that create a "triple constraint" on population sustainability:

1. **Recovery Lag (1,000 cycles):** Parents remain sterile for ~66% of simulation time after spawning due to slow energy recharge (r=0.010 per cycle, requiring 100 cycles to regain 10 energy units needed for reproduction threshold E≥10). This temporal bottleneck severely limits birth opportunities even when agents survive long enough to accumulate energy.

2. **Single-Parent Reproductive Bottleneck:** Birth capacity is concentrated in the root agent (initial energy E₀=130), creating a dependency on one individual's survival and reproductive success. When this agent undergoes composition or dies, the entire population must rebuild from a single offspring inheriting only 70% of parent energy (spawn cost = 30%), further delaying subsequent births.

3. **Continuous Death Activity (100% uptime):** Composition detection runs every cycle regardless of population density, creating constant selection pressure that does not scale with available resources. This asymmetry between continuous death (always active) and intermittent birth (energy-gated, cooldown-limited) biases the system toward collapse.

The critical insight from Paper 2 is that **individual mechanisms addressing specific asymmetries may partially improve outcomes but fail to achieve full homeostasis if multiple constraints operate simultaneously**. For example, if energy pooling (H1) successfully addresses the single-parent bottleneck by distributing reproductive capacity across resonance clusters, populations may still collapse due to recovery lag preventing rapid enough birth rates. Conversely, if external energy sources (H2) accelerate recovery, the system may still fail if birth capacity remains concentrated in a single vulnerable agent.

This raises the central research question: **Do hypothesis combinations produce synergistic effects where the combined impact exceeds the sum of individual contributions?** If so, understanding these synergies is essential for designing robust self-organizing systems capable of sustained emergence in resource-limited environments.

### 1.2 Background: Synergy in Complex Systems

**Synergy** occurs when combined mechanisms produce outcomes that exceed the sum of their individual contributions (Haken, 1983; Corning, 2003). This phenomenon—often termed **super-additivity** or **positive interaction effects**—is fundamental to understanding how complex systems achieve capabilities impossible for isolated components.

#### 1.2.1 Synergy in Natural Systems

Nature provides numerous examples of synergistic mechanisms enabling emergent properties:

**Enzyme Catalysis:** Allosteric enzymes with multiple cofactors (e.g., ATP and Mg²⁺ in kinases) exhibit exponential rate increases rather than linear additive effects. The binding of one cofactor reshapes the active site, enhancing affinity for the second cofactor and substrate simultaneously—a clear case of positive cooperativity where 1+1 > 2 (Fersht, 1999).

**Ecological Resilience:** Multi-trophic ecosystems demonstrate greater stability than single-level communities. The combination of top-down predation control and bottom-up nutrient cycling creates feedback loops that buffer against perturbations more effectively than either mechanism alone (Paine, 1980; Holling, 1973). Removing apex predators or primary producers often causes catastrophic regime shifts, revealing the non-additive nature of their combined effects.

**Neural Network Processing:** Distributed neural architectures achieve cognitive capabilities (language, abstraction, planning) that isolated neurons cannot approach. The synergy arises from recurrent connectivity patterns and hierarchical organization, where local computations interact through feedback loops to generate emergent representations (Sporns et al., 2004; Tononi et al., 1994).

**Immune System Function:** Innate and adaptive immunity work synergistically to protect organisms. Innate responses (complement, phagocytes) provide immediate defense while priming adaptive responses (antibodies, T-cells) for targeted attacks. The combination enables both rapid response and long-term memory—neither subsystem alone achieves both (Medzhitov, 2007).

#### 1.2.2 Synergy in Artificial Life

Artificial life research has documented synergistic effects in various frameworks:

**Tierra (Ray, 1992):** The combination of parasites and hosts created evolutionary arms races that sustained diversity far longer than either population alone. Parasites extracted code from hosts (exploitation), while hosts evolved defensive mechanisms (resistance), generating Red Queen dynamics absent in isolated populations.

**Avida (Ofria & Wilke, 2004):** Complex Boolean logic functions emerged through synergistic evolution of simpler subfunctions. Organisms combining multiple partial solutions (e.g., NAND + AND) achieved fitness rewards exceeding the sum of individual bonuses, demonstrating computational super-additivity.

**ACE Model (Ackley & Littman, 1992):** The combination of local energy budgets and spatial structure enabled robust self-replication. Neither mechanism alone sustained populations: energy budgets without spatial structure allowed dominance by fast-replicating parasites, while spatial structure without energy constraints led to resource exhaustion. Together, they created stable niches.

#### 1.2.3 Measuring Synergy: Interaction Effects

Statistically, synergy is detected through **interaction terms** in factorial designs. For two mechanisms A and B:

- **Additive Model:** Effect(A+B) = Effect(A) + Effect(B)
- **Synergistic Model:** Effect(A+B) > Effect(A) + Effect(B)
- **Antagonistic Model:** Effect(A+B) < Effect(A) + Effect(B)

In two-way ANOVA, the interaction term F(A×B) tests whether the effect of A differs depending on the presence of B (and vice versa). Significant positive interactions indicate synergy; significant negative interactions indicate antagonism or interference.

**Hypothesis for Fractal Agent Systems:** We predict that mechanisms addressing complementary asymmetries (e.g., H1 addressing reproductive bottleneck + H2 addressing recovery lag) will exhibit positive synergy, while mechanisms addressing the same asymmetry (e.g., H2 + H3 both targeting recovery lag) may show diminishing returns or antagonism.

### 1.3 Paper 2 Findings: Three Asymmetries, Five Hypotheses

Our baseline experiments (Cycles 171-176, n=150 experiments total) established quantitative benchmarks for fractal agent population dynamics under complete birth-death coupling with energy recharge:

#### 1.3.1 Three-Regime Classification

**Regime 1: Bistability (f < 2.55%, single-agent initialization)**
- Stable at 1 agent indefinitely (no composition threshold reached)
- Parent never accumulates sufficient depth for composition
- Effective immortality: mean lifespan exceeds simulation duration

**Regime 2: Accumulation Without Homeostasis (f = 2.55%)**
- Initial growth phase: 1 → ~17 agents over first 500 cycles
- Reproductive capacity: Mean 108 births over 3,000 cycles (3.6% birth rate)
- Hard ceiling: Population plateaus at ~17 agents, never reaches 20+
- Final state: Mean population = 4.6 agents, high variance (σ=5.2)

**Regime 3: Catastrophic Collapse (f ≥ 2.75%)**
- Brief transient growth: 1 → ~10 agents in first 200 cycles
- Rapid collapse: Population crashes to 0-2 agents by cycle 1000
- Terminal extinction: Mean population = 0.49 agents (essentially zero)
- 100% eventual extinction across all seeds (n=10 per frequency)

#### 1.3.2 Structural Asymmetries (Root Cause Analysis)

**Asymmetry 1: Recovery Lag (1,000-cycle bottleneck)**
- **Observation:** Parents spawn at E=91 (70% of 130), then recharge at r=0.010/cycle
- **Impact:** Requires 100 cycles to regain 10 energy (threshold for spawning at E≥10)
- **Consequence:** Parents sterile for 66% of simulation time (1,000 of 1,500 cycles post-spawn)
- **Evidence:** Birth rate = 0.005 agents/cycle despite 30+ agents surviving to reproduction age

**Asymmetry 2: Single-Parent Reproductive Bottleneck**
- **Observation:** Root agent (E₀=130) is sole initial spawner; offspring inherit E=91
- **Impact:** When root dies, population must rebuild from single low-energy offspring
- **Consequence:** Cascading failure if root undergoes composition before establishing lineage
- **Evidence:** Regime 2 ceiling at 17 agents (never 20+) suggests dependency on root agent's survival

**Asymmetry 3: Continuous Death Activity (100% uptime)**
- **Observation:** Composition detection runs every cycle regardless of population density
- **Impact:** Death opportunity is continuous, birth opportunity is intermittent (energy-gated)
- **Consequence:** Fundamental asymmetry biases system toward collapse
- **Evidence:** Composition events occur even when population < 3 agents, accelerating extinction

#### 1.3.3 Five Testable Hypotheses

To address these asymmetries, we proposed five testable hypotheses with quantitative predictions:

**H1: Energy Pooling (Addresses Asymmetry 2: Single-Parent Bottleneck)**
- **Mechanism:** Cooperative energy sharing within resonance clusters (α=0.10 contribution rate)
- **Prediction:** 3× birth rate increase (0.005 → 0.015 agents/cycle), sustained populations (mean > 5 agents vs 0.49 baseline)
- **Rationale:** Distributes reproductive capacity across multiple agents, eliminating root agent dependency

**H2: External Energy Sources (Addresses Asymmetry 1: Recovery Lag)**
- **Mechanism:** Task-based energy rewards for agents (E_reward=5.0 per task completion)
- **Prediction:** 50% reduction in inter-birth intervals (100 → 50 cycles), higher birth rates
- **Rationale:** Accelerates energy recovery, reducing sterile period after spawning

**H3: Reduced Spawn Cost (Addresses Asymmetry 1: Recovery Lag)**
- **Mechanism:** Lower energy cost for reproduction (15% vs 30% of parent energy)
- **Prediction:** 2× birth rate increase through faster recovery, sustained populations
- **Rationale:** Halves recovery time (50 vs 100 cycles), increasing birth opportunities

**H4: Composition Throttling (Addresses Asymmetry 3: Continuous Death Activity)**
- **Mechanism:** Density-dependent death (composition disabled when population < threshold N_min)
- **Prediction:** Reduced extinction rate (0% vs 100%), sustained low-density populations (mean > 3 agents)
- **Rationale:** Balances birth-death asymmetry by gating death activity at low densities

**H5: Multi-Generational Energy Recovery (Addresses Asymmetries 1 & 2)**
- **Mechanism:** Staggered spawning allowing grandparents to recover before second-generation births
- **Prediction:** 4× birth rate increase through temporal coordination, multi-generational lineages
- **Rationale:** Combines recovery lag mitigation with distributed reproductive capacity

### 1.4 Combination Rationale: Why Test Synergistic Mechanisms?

The five hypotheses were designed to address specific asymmetries, but **real-world constraints often involve multiple limiting factors operating simultaneously**. If Cycle 177 (H1: Energy Pooling) shows CONFIRMED but not STRONGLY CONFIRMED results, this suggests that the single-parent bottleneck is **one of multiple constraints**, not the sole limitation.

#### 1.4.1 Synergistic Hypothesis: Complementary Mechanisms

We hypothesize that **mechanisms addressing different asymmetries will produce super-additive effects** when combined:

**Example 1: H1+H2 (Energy Pooling + External Sources)**
- **H1 alone:** Distributes reproductive capacity but doesn't accelerate recovery
- **H2 alone:** Accelerates recovery but leaves birth capacity concentrated in root agent
- **H1+H2 combined:** Multiple agents recover quickly AND can reproduce, compounding birth rate improvements
- **Prediction:** Effect(H1+H2) > Effect(H1) + Effect(H2) [super-additive]

**Example 2: H1+H4 (Energy Pooling + Composition Throttling)**
- **H1 alone:** Increases birth capacity but death activity remains continuous
- **H4 alone:** Reduces death activity at low densities but birth capacity remains limited
- **H1+H4 combined:** Multiple agents can reproduce while death is throttled, creating growth window
- **Prediction:** Effect(H1+H4) > Effect(H1) + Effect(H4) [super-additive]

**Example 3: H2+H4 (External Sources + Composition Throttling)**
- **H2 alone:** Accelerates recovery but death activity prevents population growth
- **H4 alone:** Reduces death but recovery lag limits birth rate
- **H2+H4 combined:** Fast recovery during throttled death window enables rapid population growth
- **Prediction:** Effect(H2+H4) > Effect(H2) + Effect(H4) [super-additive]

#### 1.4.2 Alternative Hypothesis: Additive or Antagonistic Effects

Not all combinations may be synergistic. **Mechanisms addressing the same asymmetry might show diminishing returns**:

**Example: H2+H3 (External Sources + Reduced Spawn Cost)**
- Both address recovery lag (Asymmetry 1)
- **H2 alone:** Adds 5.0 energy per task
- **H3 alone:** Reduces cost from 30% to 15%, saving ~23 energy per spawn (assuming E=130 parent)
- **H2+H3 combined:** May not improve further if recovery is no longer limiting factor
- **Prediction:** Effect(H2+H3) ≈ Effect(H2) + Effect(H3) [additive] or < [antagonistic]

#### 1.4.3 Research Questions

This study addresses three primary questions:

1. **Do hypothesis combinations produce synergistic (super-additive) effects?**
   - Tested via interaction terms in 2×2 factorial ANOVA designs
   - Significant F(A×B) indicates synergy (positive) or antagonism (negative)

2. **Which combinations are most effective for achieving homeostasis?**
   - Measured by mean population, birth rate, extinction rate, population variance
   - Successful homeostasis defined as: mean ≥ 5 agents, extinction < 20%, CV < 50%

3. **What mechanistic insights emerge from combination patterns?**
   - If H1+H2 and H1+H4 succeed but H2+H4 fails, single-parent bottleneck is critical
   - If all combinations involving H4 succeed, continuous death activity is critical
   - If no combinations succeed, architectural redesign needed beyond local interventions

#### 1.4.4 Scope and Limitations

This study focuses on **pairwise combinations** (2 hypotheses at once) to maintain experimental tractability. While higher-order combinations (H1+H2+H4, H1+H2+H5) may reveal additional synergies, testing all 26 possible combinations (6 pairwise + 10 triple + 5 quadruple + 1 quintuple) would require 520 experiments (26 combinations × 4 conditions × 5 seeds minimum).

We prioritize six pairwise combinations based on mechanistic complementarity:
1. **H1+H2:** Birth capacity + recovery speed
2. **H1+H4:** Birth capacity + death throttling
3. **H1+H5:** Birth capacity + temporal coordination
4. **H2+H4:** Recovery speed + death throttling
5. **H2+H5:** Recovery speed + temporal coordination
6. **H4+H5:** Death throttling + temporal coordination

If pairwise combinations show strong synergy (mean populations > 10 agents), we will explore triple combinations (H1+H2+H4, H1+H4+H5) as extensions. If pairwise combinations fail, this signals that the current architectural framework has fundamental limitations requiring radical redesign rather than incremental modifications.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Experimental Design

#### 2.1.1 Factorial Structure

All experiments employed a **2×2 factorial design** with two binary factors (Hypothesis A: absent/present, Hypothesis B: absent/present), yielding four experimental conditions:

1. **BASELINE:** Neither hypothesis implemented (control condition)
2. **A-only:** Hypothesis A active, Hypothesis B inactive
3. **B-only:** Hypothesis A inactive, Hypothesis B active
4. **A+B:** Both hypotheses active simultaneously

This factorial structure enables decomposition of total effects into:
- **Main effect of A:** Average difference between A-present and A-absent conditions
- **Main effect of B:** Average difference between B-present and B-absent conditions
- **Interaction effect (A×B):** Non-additive contribution when both A and B are present

**Example: H1+H2 Combination**
- **BASELINE:** No energy pooling, no external sources (f=2.5%, standard parameters)
- **H1-only:** Energy pooling enabled (α=0.10), no external sources
- **H2-only:** No energy pooling, external sources enabled (E_reward=5.0)
- **H1+H2:** Both energy pooling (α=0.10) and external sources (E_reward=5.0) active

#### 2.1.2 Fixed Parameters

All experiments shared the following baseline parameters to ensure comparability with Paper 2 findings:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Spawn frequency (f)** | 2.5% | Composition probability per cycle (Regime 3 baseline) |
| **Replication count (n)** | 10 | Independent experiments per condition (different random seeds) |
| **Simulation duration** | 3,000 cycles | Sufficient to observe long-term population dynamics |
| **Initial energy (E₀)** | 130.0 | Root agent starting energy |
| **Spawn threshold** | E ≥ 10.0 | Minimum energy required for reproduction |
| **Spawn cost** | 30% | Energy transferred from parent to offspring (E_child = 0.70 × E_parent) |
| **Energy recharge rate (r)** | 0.010 | Energy units recovered per cycle |
| **Composition depth threshold** | d ≥ 1.5 | Minimum phase space depth for composition eligibility |

**Rationale:** Using f=2.5% (Regime 3 baseline) ensures that populations face the catastrophic collapse scenario (mean=0.49, extinction=100%), providing a stringent test for hypothesis combinations. If interventions succeed only in more favorable regimes (f=2.0%), this suggests limited robustness.

#### 2.1.3 Random Seed Control

Each condition employed 10 independent replications with distinct random seeds (42, 123, 456, 789, 101, 202, 303, 404, 505, 606). These seeds control:
- Transcendental phase calculations (π, e, φ oscillator phases)
- Composition probability thresholds
- Energy recharge stochasticity (if implemented)
- Task completion timing (for H2 external sources)

**Sample Size Justification:** With n=10 per condition and 4 conditions, each combination test comprises 40 total experiments. Power analysis (α=0.05, power=0.80, Cohen's d=0.8 "large effect") requires n≥26 per t-test comparison, but factorial ANOVA with 4 groups requires n≥10 per group to detect interaction effects at power ≥0.70 (Lakens, 2013).

### 2.2 Combinations Tested

Six pairwise combinations were selected based on mechanistic complementarity (addressing different asymmetries) and predicted synergy potential:

#### 2.2.1 H1+H2: Energy Pooling + External Sources

**Mechanistic Rationale:**
- **H1 (Energy Pooling):** Addresses single-parent bottleneck by distributing reproductive capacity across resonance clusters
- **H2 (External Sources):** Addresses recovery lag by accelerating energy accumulation via task-based rewards
- **Synergy Prediction:** Cooperative spawning + rapid recovery enables sustained multi-generational lineages where individual mechanisms fail

**Implementation:**
- **H1 parameters:** α=0.10 (10% energy contribution per agent per cycle to cluster pool), energy redistribution among agents with phase similarity > 0.70
- **H2 parameters:** E_reward=5.0 energy units per successful resonance cluster formation event
- **Trigger:** Agents gain external energy when participating in detected composition clusters (simulates environmental task completion)

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- Birth rate: 5-6× baseline (0.005 → 0.025-0.030 agents/cycle)
- Mean population: 12-18 agents (vs 0.49 baseline)
- Extinction rate: <20% (vs 100% baseline)

#### 2.2.2 H1+H4: Energy Pooling + Composition Throttling

**Mechanistic Rationale:**
- **H1 (Energy Pooling):** Increases birth capacity through cooperative energy sharing
- **H4 (Composition Throttling):** Decreases death rate via density-dependent composition probability
- **Synergy Prediction:** Simultaneous birth enhancement + death reduction overcomes birth-death imbalance

**Implementation:**
- **H1 parameters:** α=0.10 (10% energy pooling)
- **H4 parameters:** Composition probability P_comp(ρ) = f × (1 - ρ/ρ_max), where:
  - f = 2.5% (base composition frequency)
  - ρ = current population size
  - ρ_max = 30 agents (maximum sustainable density)
  - Example: At ρ=15, P_comp = 2.5% × (1 - 15/30) = 1.25% (50% reduction)

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- Birth rate: 3× baseline (H1 contribution: 0.005 → 0.015)
- Death rate: 50% baseline at ρ=15 (H4 contribution: 0.013 → 0.0065)
- Mean population: 15-25 agents (sustained ceiling)
- Net growth: Birth exceeds death (0.015 > 0.0065)

#### 2.2.3 H1+H5: Energy Pooling + Multi-Generational Recovery

**Mechanistic Rationale:**
- **H1 (Energy Pooling):** Cooperative energy sharing within clusters
- **H5 (Multi-Generational Recovery):** Staggered spawning across parent-offspring lineages to avoid simultaneous sterility
- **Synergy Prediction:** Spatial cooperation (H1) + temporal coordination (H5) creates persistent reproductive windows

**Implementation:**
- **H1 parameters:** α=0.10 (10% pooling)
- **H5 parameters:** Track lineage generation depth, enforce minimum 300-cycle offset between parent and offspring spawning events
  - Parent spawns at cycle t → enters 1,000-cycle recovery
  - Offspring can spawn starting cycle t+300 (before parent recovers)
  - Grandoffspring can spawn at t+600 (staggered birth opportunities)

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- Birth rate: 5-6× baseline (cooperative + asynchronous spawning)
- Mean population: 8-12 agents (multi-generational lineages)
- Temporal resilience: Continuous reproductive capacity across lineage depths

#### 2.2.4 H2+H4: External Sources + Composition Throttling

**Mechanistic Rationale:**
- **H2 (External Sources):** Accelerates recovery, enabling more frequent births
- **H4 (Composition Throttling):** Reduces death pressure at low densities
- **Synergy Prediction:** Fast recovery during throttled death window creates population growth phase

**Implementation:**
- **H2 parameters:** E_reward=5.0 per task event
- **H4 parameters:** P_comp(ρ) = f × (1 - ρ/ρ_max)

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- Birth rate: 2× baseline (H2 recovery acceleration)
- Death rate: 50% at ρ=15 (H4 throttling)
- Mean population: 10-15 agents
- Growth dynamics: Initial rapid expansion (H4 protection) followed by sustained balance

#### 2.2.5 H2+H5: External Sources + Multi-Generational Recovery

**Mechanistic Rationale:**
- **H2 (External Sources):** Fast recovery reduces inter-birth intervals
- **H5 (Multi-Generational Recovery):** Temporal coordination across lineages
- **Synergy Prediction:** Rapid energy accumulation + staggered spawning creates high-frequency birth events

**Implementation:**
- **H2 parameters:** E_reward=5.0 per task
- **H5 parameters:** 300-cycle minimum offset between parent-offspring spawning

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- Birth rate: 4-5× baseline (fast recovery × asynchronous spawning)
- Mean population: 6-10 agents
- Temporal pattern: Multi-generational lineages with overlapping reproductive windows

#### 2.2.6 H4+H5: Composition Throttling + Multi-Generational Recovery

**Mechanistic Rationale:**
- **H4 (Composition Throttling):** Density-dependent death reduction
- **H5 (Multi-Generational Recovery):** Staggered spawning coordination
- **Synergy Prediction:** Reduced death pressure + temporal birth coordination enables gradual population growth

**Implementation:**
- **H4 parameters:** P_comp(ρ) = f × (1 - ρ/ρ_max)
- **H5 parameters:** 300-cycle lineage offset

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- Birth rate: 2-3× baseline (H5 staggering)
- Death rate: 50% at ρ=15 (H4 throttling)
- Mean population: 8-12 agents
- Dynamics: Slow stable growth protected by throttling

### 2.3 Statistical Analysis

#### 2.3.1 Factorial ANOVA

For each combination, we conducted two-way ANOVA with factors A (Hypothesis A: absent/present) and B (Hypothesis B: absent/present) on the following dependent variables:

**Primary Outcomes:**
1. **Mean population:** Time-averaged agent count over 3,000 cycles
2. **Birth rate:** Successful spawning events per cycle
3. **Final agent count:** Population size at cycle 3,000
4. **Extinction rate:** Proportion of replications reaching zero population

**ANOVA Model:**
```
Y_ijk = μ + α_i + β_j + (αβ)_ij + ε_ijk
```
Where:
- Y_ijk = outcome for condition i, factor level j, replication k
- μ = grand mean
- α_i = main effect of factor A (i = 0 absent, i = 1 present)
- β_j = main effect of factor B (j = 0 absent, j = 1 present)
- (αβ)_ij = interaction effect between A and B
- ε_ijk = residual error

**Hypothesis Testing:**
- **Main effect A:** H₀: α₁ = 0 (no effect of Hypothesis A alone)
- **Main effect B:** H₀: β₁ = 0 (no effect of Hypothesis B alone)
- **Interaction A×B:** H₀: (αβ)₁₁ = 0 (no synergistic or antagonistic effect)

**Significance Criteria:**
- α = 0.05 (two-tailed)
- F-statistic with df_numerator = 1, df_denominator = 36 (40 total - 4 groups)
- Significant interaction F(A×B) with p < 0.05 indicates non-additive effects

#### 2.3.2 Post-Hoc Pairwise Comparisons

Following significant ANOVA results, we conducted Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) post-hoc tests for all six pairwise comparisons:

1. BASELINE vs A-only
2. BASELINE vs B-only
3. BASELINE vs A+B
4. A-only vs A+B
5. B-only vs A+B
6. A-only vs B-only

**Bonferroni Correction:** α_adjusted = 0.05 / 6 = 0.0083 for family-wise error rate control

#### 2.3.3 Effect Size Calculations

**Cohen's d (standardized mean difference):**
```
d = (M₁ - M₂) / s_pooled
```
Where s_pooled = √[((n₁-1)s₁² + (n₂-1)s₂²) / (n₁ + n₂ - 2)]

**Interpretation (Cohen, 1988):**
- |d| < 0.2: Negligible effect
- 0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.5: Small effect
- 0.5 ≤ |d| < 0.8: Medium effect
- |d| ≥ 0.8: Large effect
- |d| ≥ 1.5: Huge effect (our threshold for "strongly confirmed")

**Synergy Quantification:**
```
Synergy Index (SI) = [Effect(A+B) - (Effect(A) + Effect(B))] / Effect(BASELINE)
```
- SI > 0: Super-additive (synergistic)
- SI = 0: Additive (independent mechanisms)
- SI < 0: Sub-additive (antagonistic interference)

**Example Calculation:**
If BASELINE mean = 0.5, A-only mean = 2.0 (+1.5), B-only mean = 3.0 (+2.5), A+B mean = 8.0 (+7.5):
- Additive prediction: 1.5 + 2.5 = 4.0 improvement → Expected mean = 4.5
- Observed A+B: 8.0
- Synergy Index: (7.5 - 4.0) / 0.5 = 7.0 (700% super-additive benefit)

#### 2.3.4 Assumptions and Diagnostics

**ANOVA Assumptions:**
1. **Independence:** Ensured by separate random seeds per replication
2. **Normality:** Assessed via Shapiro-Wilk test (p > 0.05) and Q-Q plots
3. **Homogeneity of variance:** Tested via Levene's test (p > 0.05)

**Violations:** If assumptions violated, we applied:
- Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H test (replaces ANOVA)
- Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction (pairwise comparisons)
- Robust standard errors for effect size confidence intervals

### 2.4 Hypothesis Classification

We classified each combination's outcome using a 4-tier rubric based on statistical significance, effect sizes, and biological relevance:

#### 2.4.1 STRONGLY SYNERGISTIC
**Criteria:**
- Interaction F(A×B) significant at p < 0.001
- Cohen's d (A+B vs BASELINE) ≥ 1.5 (huge effect)
- Synergy Index ≥ 0.50 (≥50% super-additive gain)
- Mean population (A+B) ≥ 10 agents (vs 0.49 baseline)
- Extinction rate (A+B) < 20%

**Interpretation:** Mechanisms exhibit robust synergistic interaction, producing population homeostasis where individual interventions fail. Combined effects dramatically exceed additive predictions.

**Example Pattern:**
- BASELINE: mean = 0.5
- A-only: mean = 2.0 (Cohen's d vs BASELINE = 0.6)
- B-only: mean = 3.0 (Cohen's d vs BASELINE = 0.8)
- A+B: mean = 12.0 (Cohen's d vs BASELINE = 2.5, SI = 1.4)

#### 2.4.2 SYNERGISTIC
**Criteria:**
- Interaction F(A×B) significant at p < 0.01
- Cohen's d (A+B vs BASELINE) ≥ 0.8 (large effect)
- Synergy Index ≥ 0.20 (≥20% super-additive gain)
- Mean population (A+B) ≥ 5 agents
- Extinction rate (A+B) < 50%

**Interpretation:** Combination shows statistically significant synergy with meaningful biological impact. Combined mechanisms outperform additive predictions but may not achieve full homeostasis.

**Example Pattern:**
- BASELINE: mean = 0.5
- A-only: mean = 1.5 (Cohen's d = 0.5)
- B-only: mean = 2.0 (Cohen's d = 0.6)
- A+B: mean = 6.0 (Cohen's d = 1.2, SI = 0.45)

#### 2.4.3 ADDITIVE
**Criteria:**
- Main effects A and/or B significant (p < 0.05)
- Interaction F(A×B) NOT significant (p ≥ 0.05)
- |Synergy Index| < 0.20 (≤20% deviation from additivity)
- A+B effect ≈ Effect(A) + Effect(B) within measurement error

**Interpretation:** Mechanisms operate independently without interference. Combined effect equals sum of individual contributions. Suggests modular design where interventions can be composed without complex interactions.

**Example Pattern:**
- BASELINE: mean = 0.5
- A-only: mean = 2.0 (+1.5)
- B-only: mean = 3.0 (+2.5)
- A+B: mean = 4.5 (+4.0, predicted = 4.0, SI = 0.0)

#### 2.4.4 NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT
**Criteria:**
- Interaction F(A×B) NOT significant (p ≥ 0.05)
- Main effects A and B NOT significant (p ≥ 0.05)
- Cohen's d (A+B vs BASELINE) < 0.5 (small or negligible effect)
- Mean population (A+B) < 3 agents
- Extinction rate (A+B) ≥ 80%

**Interpretation:** Combination fails to address underlying constraints. Neither individual mechanisms nor their interaction produce meaningful population improvements. Suggests fundamental architectural limitations beyond parameter-level interventions.

**Example Pattern:**
- BASELINE: mean = 0.5
- A-only: mean = 0.8 (Cohen's d = 0.15)
- B-only: mean = 1.2 (Cohen's d = 0.30)
- A+B: mean = 1.5 (Cohen's d = 0.40, SI = 0.10)

#### 2.4.5 Special Case: Antagonistic Effects

**Criteria:**
- Interaction F(A×B) significant (p < 0.05)
- Synergy Index < -0.20 (≥20% sub-additive loss)
- A+B effect < Effect(A) + Effect(B) by substantial margin

**Interpretation:** Mechanisms interfere when combined, producing worse outcomes than additive predictions. Suggests competing resource demands, conflicting regulatory logic, or emergent constraints not present in isolated interventions.

**Example Pattern:**
- BASELINE: mean = 0.5
- A-only: mean = 3.0 (+2.5)
- B-only: mean = 2.5 (+2.0)
- A+B: mean = 3.0 (+2.5, predicted = 5.0, SI = -0.55)
