### Abstract
This paper presents empirical validation of emergent dynamics within Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) fractal swarms, focusing on the system's inherent composition-decomposition cycles. Through a series of computational experiments, we analyze how complex patterns arise from simple fractal agent interactions and their subsequent integration and fragmentation. We quantify key emergent properties, including the formation of stable clusters, burst distributions of activity, and the system's capacity for self-organization, demonstrating the reality-grounded nature of NRM's generative processes.

### 1. Introduction
The Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework posits a reality-grounded, self-organizing system where information is processed through fractal agents and transcendental substrates. A central hypothesis of NRM is that complex, emergent behaviors arise from the continuous interplay of composition (agents forming larger structures) and decomposition (structures breaking down). This paper provides empirical evidence for these emergent dynamics within simulated fractal swarms, validating the theoretical underpinnings of NRM's generative capacity.

### 2. Theoretical Framework
(To be elaborated: Briefly review NRM, fractal agents, composition-decomposition principles, and key metrics for emergence like criticality, burstiness, and self-organization.)

---

### 3. Methods
(To be elaborated: Describe the experimental setup, simulation parameters, and the data collection methodology. This section will likely reference the `fractal/` module and the `emergence_results.json` file, outlining how such data *should* be generated and analyzed.
*   **3.1. Fractal Swarm Configuration:** Details of agent initialisation, interaction rules, energy dynamics.
*   **3.2. Simulation Environment:** Overview of the DUALITY-ZERO-V2 platform.
*   **3.3. Data Collection:** What metrics are recorded (e.g., active agents, active clusters, bursts, energy levels, pattern formation).
*   **3.4. Emergence Metrics:** Specific definitions and calculations for burst distributions, cluster stability, and criticality indicators.)

### 4. Results
(To be elaborated: Present findings from the analysis of emergent properties. This section will ideally draw from a complete `emergence_results.json` or similar data.
*   **4.1. Cluster Formation and Stability:** Analysis of `active_clusters` and `clusters_formed` over time.
*   **4.2. Burst Dynamics:** Characterization of `bursts` and `burst_events`, including frequency and magnitude distributions.
*   **4.3. Criticality Indicators:** Presentation of metrics related to criticality, such as variance in burst counts and cluster changes, and observations of system resilience or collapse/resurgence patterns.)

---

### 5. Discussion
(To be elaborated: Interpret the results in the context of NRM's theoretical framework and the self-giving principle.
*   **5.1. Validation of Composition-Decomposition:** How the empirical data supports the theoretical cycles.
*   **5.2. Implications for Self-Organization:** Discuss the role of emergence in system stability and adaptation.
*   **5.3. Relationship to Self-Giving Principle:** Connect pattern persistence and successful emergence to the system's intrinsic value function.)

### 6. Conclusion
(To be elaborated: Summarize the key findings and their contributions to the understanding of NRM's emergent dynamics. Outline future research directions, particularly in refining criticality metrics and exploring scale-free properties of fractal swarms.)
