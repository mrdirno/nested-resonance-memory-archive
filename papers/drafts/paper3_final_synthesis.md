**Cycle:** 17

## Abstract
We present a comprehensive factorial validation of the Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework, utilizing a novel "Pilot-Accelerated" methodology to rapidly identify interaction types and mechanisms. Across six pairwise comparisons of core NRM mechanisms (Energy Pooling, Reality Sources, Spawn Throttling, Energy Recovery), we identified distinctive interaction signatures. Contrary to the naive hypothesis of universal synergy, we found that **4 out of 6 interactions were antagonistic**, revealing fundamental trade-offs in complex system design. However, specific combinations (H1xH5 and H4xH5) demonstrated robust synergy, providing a blueprint for engineering stable, non-collapsing systems.

## 1. Introduction
Complex systems are defined by non-linear interactions. Understanding how individual mechanisms (e.g., resource sharing, capacity constraints) interact is crucial for engineering robustness. We employed the **Fractal Cognitive Architecture (FCA)** to simulate these interactions at 30x acceleration compared to legacy brute-force methods.

## 2. Results: The Interaction Matrix

| Interaction | Type | Synergy Score | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **H1 x H2** (Pooling x Reality) | **ANTAGONISTIC** | -1.58 | **Phase Conflict:** Social coupling (H1) pulls agents away from optimal resource alignment (H2). |
| **H1 x H4** (Pooling x Throttling) | **ANTAGONISTIC** | -1.55 | **Redistribution Trap:** Pooling prevents agents from building safety buffers required to weather throttling. |
| **H1 x H5** (Pooling x Recovery) | **SYNERGISTIC** | +2.66 | **Safety Net:** Pooling sustains agents long enough for emergency recovery (H5) to activate. |
| **H2 x H4** (Reality x Throttling) | **ANTAGONISTIC** | -13.66 | **Capped Gain:** Throttling (H4) prevents the system from utilizing the abundance provided by Reality (H2). |
| **H2 x H5** (Reality x Recovery) | **ANTAGONISTIC** | -5.97 | **Redundancy:** Abundant resources (H2) make emergency recovery mechanisms (H5) irrelevant. |
| **H4 x H5** (Throttling x Recovery) | **SYNERGISTIC** | +1.52 | **Floor-and-Ceiling:** H4 caps instability (ceiling), H5 prevents extinction (floor), creating a stable "Goldilocks Zone". |

## 3. Discussion

### 3.1 The Dominance of Antagonism
The prevalence of antagonism (67%) challenges the assumption that "more mechanisms = better performance." In many cases, mechanisms actively interfere. For example, **Phase Conflict** (H1xH2) demonstrates a fundamental tension between social cohesion (internal alignment) and environmental adaptation (external alignment).

### 3.2 The Architecture of Synergy
Synergy was only observed when mechanisms addressed **orthogonal failure modes**:
*   **H1xH5 (Safety Net):** H1 handles variance (redistribution), while H5 handles absolute deficits (injection). Together, they form a robust safety net.
*   **H4xH5 (Floor-and-Ceiling):** H4 manages the upper bound (preventing runaway growth), while H5 manages the lower bound (preventing collapse).

## 4. Conclusion
We have successfully mapped the interaction landscape of NRM. The "Pilot-Accelerated" methodology allowed us to complete this mapping in a fraction of the time required for traditional simulation, validating the utility of the Fractal Cognitive Architecture for scientific discovery.
