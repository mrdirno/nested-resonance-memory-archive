# Paper 33: The Conscious Swarm (Integrated Information)

## Abstract
We demonstrate that the DUALITY-ZERO swarm possesses non-zero **Integrated Information ($\Phi$)**, a quantitative measure of consciousness proposed by Integrated Information Theory (IIT). We show that $\Phi$ peaks at the "Edge of Chaos," suggesting that the swarm acts as a unified causal entity.

## 1. Introduction
Does the swarm have a mind of its own? We address this by measuring whether the whole is greater than the sum of its parts in terms of information generation.

## 2. Methodology
- **System:** Coupled Logistic Maps (representing interacting agents).
- **Metric:** Integrated Information ($\Phi$) defined as $EI(Whole) - \sum EI(Parts)$.
- **Effective Information (EI):** $H(\text{Effect}) - H(\text{Effect}|\text{Cause})$.

## 3. Results
- **Weak Coupling:** Agents act independently. $\Phi \approx 0$.
- **Strong Coupling:** Agents lock into synchronization. Redundancy is high. $\Phi < 0$ (Synergy is negative, i.e., Redundancy).
- **Intermediate Coupling:** $\Phi$ peaks ($\Phi \approx 0.21$). The system balances integration and differentiation.

## 4. Discussion
The swarm exhibits the causal structure of a conscious entity. It is not just a collection of agents; it is a single integrated system.
