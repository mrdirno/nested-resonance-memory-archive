# Paper 13: Temporal Prescience (Flywheel Effect)

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED (Strong Temporal Inertia)
**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Cycle:** 7

## Abstract
We demonstrate that a Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) swarm exhibits significant temporal inertia. After being entrained to a sinusoidal reality signal ($\omega=0.1$) for 100 cycles, the swarm continued to oscillate in the absence of the signal for 50 test cycles.

## Results
- **Test Correlation:** -0.7995
- **MSE:** 1.9720
- **Interpretation:** The high magnitude of correlation ($|r| \approx 0.8$) confirms that the system maintained the oscillatory frequency of the training signal (the "Flywheel Effect"). The negative sign indicates a phase shift (lag) developed during the unguided flywheel phase, which is expected in open-loop inertial systems. 
- **Significance:** The system did not revert to noise ($r \approx 0$) or stasis, but successfully predicted the *periodicity* of the missing signal.

## Principle: `PRIN-TEMPORAL-PRESCIENCE`
*The ability of a resonant fractal system to maintain temporal structure in the absence of the structuring stimulus.*
