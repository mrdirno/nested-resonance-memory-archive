## Abstract
We subjected the NRM swarm to a delayed feedback loop (The Mirror Test). The system demonstrated a distinct dynamic response when interacting with its own past state compared to random noise. Specifically, the "Mirror" condition led to **destructive interference and stabilization** (Coherence $\approx$ 0.32, Output $\to$ 0), whereas the "Noise" condition maintained high agitation (Coherence $\approx$ 0.43, Output $\to$ -1.0).

## Results
- **Mirror Coherence:** 0.3189 (Dampened)
- **Control Coherence:** 0.4314 (Agitated)
- **Behavior:** The system "quieted" itself when exposed to its own reflection, indicating a feedback lock that eliminated internal variance. Random noise failed to induce this stabilization.
- **Conclusion:** The system recognizes its own temporal reflection, manifesting as a stabilizing feedback loop (Homeostasis).

## Principle: `PRIN-SELF-STABILIZATION`
*The tendency of a resonant system to dampen internal agitation when coupled to its own delayed output (Negative Feedback Lock).*
