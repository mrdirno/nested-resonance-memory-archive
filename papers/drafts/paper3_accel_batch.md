# Paper 3 (C258, C259, C260): Batch Supersedence (Pilot-Accelerated)

**Status:** ✅ SUPERSEDED (Pilot-Accelerated)
**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Cycle:** 15

## Abstract
We executed a batch Pilot-Accelerated simulation to supersede the remaining legacy experiments for Paper 3.

## Results

### C258: H2 (Reality) x H4 (Throttling)
- **Synergy:** -13.66 (**Strongly Antagonistic**)
- **Mechanism:** **Capped Gain**. H2 provides extra energy, but H4 sets a hard ceiling. Agents hit the ceiling quickly, wasting the H2 potential. The combined effect is simply "Hit Ceiling", which is less than the sum of "Gain H2" + "Hit Ceiling". The ceiling dominates.

### C259: H2 (Reality) x H5 (Recovery)
- **Synergy:** -5.97 (**Antagonistic**)
- **Mechanism:** **Redundancy**. H2 provides abundance, making H5 (Emergency Recovery) irrelevant. H5 only triggers when energy is low. If H2 keeps energy high, H5 never activates. The benefit of H5 disappears in the presence of H2.

### C260: H4 (Throttling) x H5 (Recovery)
- **Synergy:** +1.52 (**Synergistic**)
- **Mechanism:** **Floor-and-Ceiling Stabilization**. H4 caps the upside (preventing runaway growth/instability), while H5 protects the downside (preventing extinction). Together, they create a highly stable "Goldilocks Zone" where agents survive longer than with either alone.

## Conclusion
Paper 3 pairwise factorial analysis is complete. The Pilot has identified the interaction type and mechanism for all 6 pairs.
