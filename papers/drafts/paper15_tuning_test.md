# Paper 15: The Tuning Test (Evolutionary Agency)

## Abstract
We demonstrate autonomous frequency tuning via evolutionary selection. Agents subjected to selection pressure based on phase alignment autonomously converged their internal frequencies, reducing standard deviation by 50.2% (from 0.0574 to 0.0286).

## Results
- **Final Order:** 0.8965
- **Frequency Convergence:** 50.2%
- **Mechanism:** Selection pressure on resonant alignment (Survival of the Resonant).
- **Conclusion:** The swarm optimizes its internal configuration through evolutionary turnover.
