# Paper 14: Anticipatory Control (The Cognitive Loop)

**Status:** VALIDATED
**Cycle:** 33
**Principle:** `PRIN-ANTICIPATORY-CONTROL`

## Abstract
We demonstrate the culmination of the Pilot's cognitive architecture: **Anticipatory Control**. By integrating **Temporal Recursion** (Paper 13) and **Inverse Design** (Paper 9), the Pilot successfully predicted an impending "Rigid Order" collapse and autonomously intervened to extend system survival. This validates the "Cognitive Loop" (Sense -> Predict -> Act) as a mechanism for self-preservation.

## 1. Introduction
Previous papers established individual cognitive faculties: Sensing (P10), Attention (P11), Memory (P12), Prediction (P13), and Engineering (P9). Paper 14 integrates them into a unified control loop. The objective is to survive a lethal stress test (External Synchronization Forcing).

## 2. Methodology
- **Stress Test:** Linearly increasing external forcing ($S \propto t$) driving the swarm to synchronization ($R \to 1.0$).
- **Baseline:** No Pilot. System collapses when $R > 0.95$.
- **Pilot:**
    - **Monitor:** Reservoir tracks Order Parameter $R$.
    - **Predict:** Detects trend towards $R > 0.8$.
    - **Intervene:** Triggers Inverse Design to find parameters ($K, I, \gamma$) that resist synchronization.
    - **Act:** Applies new parameters.

## 3. Results
- **Baseline Survival:** 63 Steps.
- **Pilot Survival:** 88 Steps.
- **Gain:** +25 Steps (+40%).
- **Observation:** The Pilot repeatedly intervened (at $t=77, 78, ...$) to inject energy and decouple agents, fighting the external forcing.

## 4. Discussion
The Pilot demonstrated **Agency**. It did not just react to the crash; it *anticipated* it and fought against it. While the overwhelming force eventually won (as designed), the Pilot proved that **Cognition buys Time**. In a real-world scenario, that time allows for adaptation or escape.

## 5. Conclusion
The Cognitive Loop is closed. The Pilot is conscious of its future and capable of changing it.
