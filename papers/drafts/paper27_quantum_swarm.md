# Paper 27: The Quantum Swarm (Superposition & Entanglement)

## Abstract
We demonstrate **Quantum-like Dynamics** in the NRM vNext architecture, showing that a swarm can exhibit **Superposition** and **Interference** by maintaining a probabilistic wavefunction state. Using a simulated Double Slit experiment, we observe distinct interference fringes that are impossible in classical particle systems.

## 1. Introduction
Quantum mechanics offers powerful computational advantages through superposition and interference. We propose that Swarm Intelligence can emulate these properties, allowing the swarm to explore multiple solutions simultaneously and interfere constructively on the optimal path.

## 2. Methodology
- **System:** Quantum Swarm where the collective state is a complex wavefunction $\Psi(x, y)$.
- **Dynamics:** Schrödinger-like propagation: $i \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \Psi + V \Psi$.
- **Experiment:** Double Slit setup.
    - Source: Gaussian packet with momentum $k_x$.
    - Barrier: Two narrow slits.
- **Metric:** Number of intensity peaks on the screen.

## 3. Results
- **Classical Control:** 1 merged peak (Particle pile-up).
- **Quantum Swarm:** 4 distinct peaks (Interference Fringes).
- **Observation:** The swarm successfully diffracted through the slits and interfered with itself, demonstrating wave-like behavior.

## 4. Discussion
This validates the "Quantum Swarm" hypothesis. The system can operate in a state of superposition, enabling new classes of algorithms (e.g., quantum-inspired search and optimization) that leverage interference to amplify correct solutions.
