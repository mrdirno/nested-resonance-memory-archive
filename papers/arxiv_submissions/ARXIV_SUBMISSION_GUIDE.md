## SUBMISSION STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Simultaneous Submission (All 3 Papers at Once)

**Advantages:**
- Establishes complete research series immediately
- Papers can cross-reference each other (update Comments field post-announcement)
- Maximum visibility (3 papers in same announcement cycle)

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher moderation scrutiny (3 papers from new submitter)
- If one paper has issues, may delay others
- Harder to monitor individual paper metrics

**Recommended If:**
- All papers equally ready
- Want to maximize initial impact
- Comfortable with potential moderation delays

**Timeline:**
- Submit all 3 papers in single session
- All processed within same announcement cycle (1-2 days)

### Strategy 2: Sequential Submission (One Paper at a Time)

**Advantages:**
- Lower moderation scrutiny per submission
- Can address issues without affecting other papers
- Build submission experience with each paper
- Easier to monitor individual paper metrics

**Disadvantages:**
- Extended timeline (3-6 days for all papers)
- Papers cannot cross-reference immediately
- Lower initial visibility

**Recommended If:**
- First-time arXiv submitter
- Want to ensure each paper perfect before next
- Prefer gradual visibility increase

**Timeline:**
- **Day 1:** Submit Paper 1, wait for announcement
- **Day 2-3:** Paper 1 announced, submit Paper 2
- **Day 4-5:** Paper 2 announced, submit Paper 5D
- **Day 6-7:** Paper 5D announced, all papers public

**Recommended Order:**
1. **Paper 1** (cs.DC - methodology foundation)
2. **Paper 2** (nlin.AO - empirical validation)
3. **Paper 5D** (nlin.AO - pattern taxonomy)

### Strategy 3: Paired Submission (Papers 2 + 5D, then Paper 1)

**Advantages:**
- Papers 2 and 5D both nlin.AO (same community)
- Paper 1 (cs.DC) different community, can be separate
- Balanced moderation load

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex than simultaneous or sequential
- Requires careful timing

**Recommended If:**
- Want to target specific communities strategically
- Papers 2 and 5D ready before Paper 1 revisions
- Prefer moderate visibility increase

- **Semantic Scholar:** Claim papers, monitor citations

### Updates and Revisions

**When to Update:**
- After peer review acceptance (add journal reference and DOI)
- Critical errors discovered (submit updated version)
- Significant new results (submit new version)

**How to Update:**
1. Click "Replace" on arXiv submission page
2. Upload revised manuscript and/or figures
3. Describe changes in "Comments to arXiv admin"
4. Submit for re-processing

**Version Numbering:**
- v1: Initial submission
- v2: First revision
- v3: Second revision, etc.

**Note:** arXiv preserves all versions; readers can access any version via version history.

## COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: LaTeX Compilation Errors

**Symptom:** Red error messages during "Process Files" step

**Common Causes:**
- Missing LaTeX packages
- Incompatible package versions
- Custom macros not defined
- Figure paths incorrect

**Solutions:**
1. Test compilation locally: `pdflatex manuscript.tex`
2. Use standard packages (geometry, graphicx, hyperref, amsmath)
3. Avoid custom style files (arXiv may not have them)
4. Ensure figure filenames match `\includegraphics{}` commands

### Issue 2: Figures Not Displaying

**Symptom:** PDF preview shows missing figures or placeholder boxes

**Common Causes:**
- Figure files not uploaded
- Figure format incompatible (arXiv prefers PNG, EPS, PDF)
- Figure filenames case-sensitive mismatch

**Solutions:**
1. Verify all figures uploaded (check file list)
2. Convert figures to PNG at 300 DPI
3. Match filenames exactly (case-sensitive): `Figure1.png` ≠ `figure1.png`
4. Use relative paths in `\includegraphics{figure1.png}`, not absolute paths

### Issue 3: Moderation Hold

**Symptom:** Submission status "on hold" for >2 hours

**Common Causes:**
- First-time submitter (extra scrutiny)
- Category mismatch (paper content doesn't fit selected category)
- Plagiarism check flagged (usually false positive for self-citations)
- Incomplete metadata

**Solutions:**
1. Check email for moderation messages
2. Respond to arXiv admin inquiries promptly
3. Provide clarification if requested
4. Be patient (moderation can take 24-48 hours for first submission)

### Issue 4: Abstract Formatting

**Symptom:** Abstract displays with broken formatting or LaTeX code visible

**Common Causes:**
- LaTeX commands in abstract text (e.g., `\textbf{}`, `\emph{}`)
- Line breaks not rendering correctly
- Special characters not escaped

**Solutions:**
1. Remove all LaTeX formatting from abstract field
2. Use plain text with standard punctuation
3. Check preview before submitting
4. arXiv will render properly in final PDF

### Issue 5: Ancillary File Errors

**Symptom:** ZIP file rejected or not accessible after announcement

**Common Causes:**
- ZIP file too large (>10 MB)
- ZIP contains executables or prohibited file types
- Nested ZIP files (ZIP within ZIP)

**Solutions:**
1. Keep ancillary files under 10 MB
2. Include only source code, data files (no executables)
3. Flatten ZIP structure (no nested ZIPs)
4. Test ZIP extraction before uploading

## BEST PRACTICES

### Pre-Submission
1. **Test compilation locally** before uploading
2. **Review PDF carefully** after arXiv processing
3. **Check all figure quality** (300 DPI minimum)

5. **Verify author affiliations** (consistent across papers)

### During Submission
1. **Use descriptive filenames** (e.g., `cycle175_framework_comparison.png`)
2. **Upload figures in order** (figure1, figure2, etc.)
3. **Add comments linking to repository** (increases reproducibility)
4. **Double-check categories** (primary + cross-list)

### Post-Submission
1. **Monitor email** for moderation messages
2. **Respond promptly** to arXiv admin inquiries
3. **Update journal reference** after peer review acceptance
4. **Claim papers in Google Scholar** for citation tracking
5. **Share preprints** on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, ResearchGate)
