\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\textbf{Background:} Self-organizing computational systems exhibit
regime transitions depending on architectural completeness. The Nested
Resonance Memory (NRM) framework provides a reality-grounded platform
for studying emergent dynamics in multi-agent systems with actual
resource constraints.

\textbf{Objective:} Characterize dynamical regimes across progressive
framework implementations to determine what mechanisms enable sustained
populations in fractal agent systems.

\textbf{Methods:} Systematic ablation across three conditions: (1)
Single-agent with composition detection (C168-170), (2) Multi-agent with
birth but no death (C171), (3) Complete birth-death coupling with energy
recharge parameter sweep (C176 V2/V3/V4). Recharge rates: r $\in$ \{0.000,
0.001, 0.010\} spanning 100× range. Each condition: n=10 seeds, f=2.5\%,
3,000 cycles.

\textbf{Results:} Three distinct regimes identified (Figure 1).
\textbf{Regime 1 (Bistability):} Single-agent models exhibit sharp
transition at f\_crit $\approx$ 2.55\% with bistable attractors (Basin A/B).
\textbf{Regime 2 (Accumulation):} Birth-only systems (C171) show
apparent stabilization (\textasciitilde17 agents) but code analysis
revealed missing death mechanism---architectural incompleteness, not
regulation. \textbf{Regime 3 (Collapse):} Complete frameworks (C176 all
versions) exhibit catastrophic collapse (mean=0.49 ± 0.50, CV=101\%)
\textbf{regardless of recharge rate}. Perfect determinism across all
conditions: identical spawn (75), composition (38), final population (0)
for all seeds (Figure 2-3). Statistical tests confirm zero effect of
energy recharge (F(2,27)=0.00, p=1.000, $\eta$²=0.000). Death rate
(\textasciitilde0.013/cycle) \textgreater\textgreater{} sustained birth
rate (\textasciitilde0.005/cycle) creates extinction attractor (Figure
4).

\textbf{Conclusions:} Birth-death coupling is \textbf{necessary but NOT
sufficient} for sustained populations. Energy recharge enables
individual recovery but fails to overcome population-level death-birth
imbalance across 100× parameter range. Hypothesis testing (C177 H1)
\textbf{rejected energy pooling} as primary mechanism (Cohen's d=0.0,
p=1.0), confirming temporal asymmetry dominance over resource
distribution bottlenecks. This falsification redirects focus to
alternative mechanisms: (2) external energy sources (task rewards), (4)
composition throttling, (5) multi-generational recovery. Future
factorial experiments (C255-C260) will test these hypotheses
individually and in combination.

\subsection{1. Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsubsection{1.1 Motivation: Energy Constraints in Self-Organizing
Systems}\label{motivation-energy-constraints-in-self-organizing-systems}

Self-organizing systems across biological, physical, and computational
domains face a fundamental challenge: how to sustain emergent structure
and dynamics in the presence of resource constraints (Kauffman, 1993;
Prigogine \& Stengers, 1984). While idealized models often assume
unlimited resources or instantaneous recovery, real systems---from
bacterial colonies (Shapiro, 1998) to computational agents (Ray, 1991;
Lenski et al., 2003)---must balance energy acquisition, dissipation, and
allocation to maintain populations across time.

In artificial life and multi-agent systems, this challenge becomes
particularly acute when implementing complete birth-death coupling:
agents that can both spawn offspring (birth) and be removed from the
population (death). Early work in artificial chemistry (Dittrich et al.,
2001) and agent-based evolution (Bedau et al., 2000) demonstrated that
birth alone leads to population accumulation and eventual collapse from
resource exhaustion, while death alone produces deterministic
extinction. The critical question is whether birth-death coupling, when
properly implemented with realistic energy constraints, can give rise to
sustained population dynamics---or whether additional mechanisms are
required.

Reality-grounded computational models---systems constrained by actual
machine resources rather than abstract parameters---provide unique
insight into this question (Ackley \& Cannon, 2011; Sayama, 2009). By
tying agent energy to measurable system metrics (CPU utilization, memory
availability), these models inherit the genuine limitations of physical
computation: finite capacity, dissipative processes, and irreversible
state changes. This grounding eliminates the possibility of ``free
energy'' and forces confrontation with the same death-birth balance
challenges faced by biological populations.

The Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework---introduced in our previous
work (Paper 1)---implements fractal agency with
composition-decomposition cycles driven by transcendental oscillators
($\pi$, e, $\varphi$). In simplified single-agent implementations, this framework
exhibits sharp phase transitions between bistable attractors as a
function of spawn frequency (Payopay \& Claude, 2025). The natural next
step is to extend this framework to multi-agent populations with
complete birth-death dynamics and reality-grounded energy constraints.
Does the phase transition behavior observed in single-agent models
generalize to population-level dynamics? Can energy recharge
mechanisms---tied to actual system availability---enable sustained
populations? Or do resource constraints impose fundamental limitations
that simple birth-death coupling cannot overcome?

This paper addresses these questions through systematic ablation studies
across three architectural variants: simplified single-agent models
(composition detection only), incomplete multi-agent frameworks (birth
without death), and complete implementations (birth-death coupling with
reality-grounded energy recharge). Our findings reveal not two but
\textbf{three distinct dynamical regimes}, with the complete framework
exhibiting catastrophic population collapse despite energy recharge
mechanisms---a result that contradicts initial theoretical predictions
and opens new research directions in cooperative energy management and
population sustainability.

\subsubsection{1.2 Background: Phase Transitions, Population Dynamics,
and Energy
Budgets}\label{background-phase-transitions-population-dynamics-and-energy-budgets}

\textbf{1.2.1 Phase Transitions in Simplified Models}

The study of phase transitions in complex systems has a rich history
spanning statistical physics (Ising, 1925), ecology (May, 1976), and
artificial life (Langton, 1990). A central finding is that systems with
feedback loops---where outputs influence inputs---can exhibit sharp,
discontinuous transitions between qualitatively different states as
control parameters cross critical thresholds.

In our previous work (Paper 1), we demonstrated such a transition in
single-agent NRM models: composition event rates undergo a sharp change
at critical spawn frequency f\_crit $\approx$ 2.55\%, producing bistable
attractors. Agents initialized below this threshold settle into Basin B
(low composition, \textless2.5 events/100 cycles), while those above
enter Basin A (high composition, \textgreater2.5 events/100 cycles).
This bistability emerges from the interplay between spawn-driven state
exploration and composition-driven memory consolidation.

However, these simplified models have a critical limitation: they lack
population dynamics. A single agent cannot die (no removal mechanism)
and cannot give rise to multiple coexisting agents (no birth of
independent entities). The question naturally arises: \textbf{what
happens when we introduce multi-agent populations with birth and death
processes?}

\textbf{1.2.2 Population Collapse in Multi-Agent Systems}

Multi-agent systems with birth-death coupling face the challenge of
balancing reproductive rate against mortality rate (Lotka, 1925;
Volterra, 1926). In deterministic settings, sustained populations
require birth rate $\geq$ death rate; in stochastic settings, extinction
becomes inevitable unless population size or immigration maintains
numbers above critical thresholds (Lande, 1993).

Artificial life research has documented numerous instances of population
collapse in agent-based models: - \textbf{Tierra} (Ray, 1991): Parasite
evolution led to boom-bust cycles and eventual extinction without
careful parameter tuning - \textbf{Avida} (Lenski et al., 2003):
Population stability required mutation rate balancing (too high: error
catastrophe; too low: extinction via drift) - \textbf{Polyworld}
(Yaeger, 1994): Sustained populations needed energy influx from
environment, not just internal recycling - \textbf{Framsticks}
(Komosinski \& Ulatowski, 1999): Reproductive costs had to be carefully
tuned relative to energy acquisition rates

A common theme emerges: \textbf{birth-death coupling alone is
insufficient} without mechanisms to balance reproductive investment
against mortality or provide sustained energy influx.

\textbf{1.2.3 Energy Budget Models}

Energy budget approaches---tracking energy acquisition, allocation, and
dissipation---provide mechanistic frameworks for understanding
population sustainability (Kooijman, 2000; Brown et al., 2004). In
agent-based models, energy budgets typically include: 1. \textbf{Initial
endowment:} Energy allocated to new agents at birth 2.
\textbf{Maintenance costs:} Dissipation over time (entropy, decay) 3.
\textbf{Reproductive costs:} Energy transferred from parent to offspring
4. \textbf{Acquisition rates:} Energy gained from environment or
computation 5. \textbf{Thresholds:} Minimum energy required for
reproduction or survival

When reproductive costs exceed acquisition rates, populations inevitably
collapse---no matter how cleverly agents behave. The critical parameter
is \textbf{energy recharge rate relative to spawn threshold}: can agents
recover enough energy between reproductive events to sustain
multi-generational lineages?

In reality-grounded models, energy recharge cannot be set arbitrarily
high---it must reflect actual system availability. This constraint
introduces a natural test: \textbf{is the energy available from idle
computational resources sufficient to sustain agent populations with
realistic spawn costs and death rates?}

\textbf{1.2.4 Theory-Driven Parameter Validation}

A challenge in computational modeling is distinguishing between
fundamental limitations and poor parameter choices. Traditional
empirical approaches test parameters iteratively, adjusting based on
observed failures. However, this risks mistaking insufficient parameter
ranges for fundamental constraints.

Theory-driven parameter validation addresses this by calculating
required parameter values from first principles before running
experiments (Wilensky \& Rand, 2015). For energy budget models, this
involves: 1. Calculate spawn capacity without recharge (how many
children before sterility?) 2. Determine recovery time to spawn
threshold (how long to regain reproductive capacity?) 3. Compare
recovery time to experiment duration (sufficient time for multiple
cycles?) 4. Predict population outcomes based on death-birth balance

If theoretical calculations predict failure, parameters can be corrected
before wasting computational resources. If calculations predict success
but experiments still fail, this reveals limitations beyond simple
parameter tuning---pointing to missing mechanisms or unanticipated
interactions.

We employ this approach in the current work, using theoretical energy
budget analysis to guide parameter choices and interpret experimental
outcomes. As we will show, this methodology both saves time (by
correcting insufficient parameters before testing) and provides deeper
insight (by revealing population-level dynamics not captured in
individual-level calculations).

\subsubsection{1.3 Research Questions}\label{research-questions}

The background above motivates four central research questions:

\textbf{RQ1: What dynamical regimes emerge across progressive framework
implementations?}

Starting from simplified single-agent bistability models and progressing
to complete multi-agent frameworks with birth-death coupling, do we
observe continuous evolution of dynamics or discrete regime transitions?
Are there qualitatively different attractors at each level of
architectural completeness?

\textbf{RQ2: Is birth-death coupling sufficient for sustained
populations?}

When death mechanisms are properly implemented (agents removed from
population after composition events), can energy recharge---tied to
reality-grounded system availability---enable sustained
multi-generational populations? Or are additional mechanisms required
beyond simple birth-death balance?

\textbf{RQ3: How do energy constraints affect population-level
death-birth balance?}

Individual-level energy budget analysis can predict when single agents
recover reproductive capacity. Does this translate to population
sustainability? Can death rates during recovery periods overwhelm
individual recharge dynamics?

\textbf{RQ4: What mechanisms beyond energy recharge might enable
sustained populations?}

If energy recharge proves insufficient (despite theoretical adequacy at
individual level), what alternative or complementary mechanisms could
address death-birth imbalance? Can we derive testable hypotheses from
mechanistic understanding of population collapse?

\subsubsection{1.4 Contributions}\label{contributions}

This paper makes four primary contributions to understanding dynamical
regimes in self-organizing multi-agent systems:

\textbf{1. Three-Regime Classification}

We provide the first systematic characterization of dynamical regimes
across progressive NRM framework implementations: - \textbf{Regime 1
(Bistability):} Single-agent models with composition detection only,
exhibiting sharp phase transitions and bistable attractors -
\textbf{Regime 2 (Accumulation):} Multi-agent systems with birth but no
death mechanism, producing population accumulation to ceiling rather
than true homeostatic regulation - \textbf{Regime 3 (Collapse):}
Complete birth-death coupled frameworks with reality-grounded energy
constraints, exhibiting catastrophic population collapse despite energy
recharge mechanisms

Each regime is characterized by distinct phase space structure,
attractor dynamics, and population trajectories (Figure 1). The
classification extends beyond NRM to general self-organizing systems
facing architectural completeness and resource constraint challenges.

\textbf{2. Fundamental Energy Constraint Discovery}

Through controlled parameter sweep across 100× range of energy recharge
rates (r $\in$ \{0.000, 0.001, 0.010\}), we demonstrate that energy recharge
mechanisms are \textbf{insufficient to overcome population collapse} in
complete frameworks (Figure 2). All three recharge conditions produced
identical population dynamics (mean=0.49 ± 0.50, perfect determinism
across all random seeds, Figure 3), revealing a fundamental death-birth
imbalance rather than a parameter tuning issue.

Statistical analysis confirms zero effect of recharge rate on any
population metric (one-way ANOVA: F(2,27)=0.00, p=1.000, $\eta$²=0.000).
Mechanistic analysis reveals death rate (\textasciitilde0.013
agents/cycle) persistently exceeds sustained birth rate
(\textasciitilde0.005 agents/cycle), creating a powerful extinction
attractor that energy recharge cannot overcome (Figure 4).

This finding contradicts initial theoretical predictions based on
individual-level energy budget analysis, revealing critical distinction
between individual recovery capacity and population-level
sustainability.

\textbf{3. Theory-Driven Parameter Validation Methodology}

We demonstrate value of analytical pre-validation in computational
experiments. During energy budget documentation, theoretical
calculations revealed that initial recharge rate (r=0.001) was 10× too
low to enable recovery within experiment duration. Immediate correction
to r=0.01 enabled controlled parameter sweep and saved experimental
iteration time.

However, the corrected parameters still produced population
collapse---revealing that individual-level predictions (recovery time to
spawn threshold) do not guarantee population-level outcomes (sustained
birth rate \textgreater{} death rate). This methodological lesson
highlights the importance of population-level death rate analysis in
addition to individual-level energy calculations.

\textbf{4. Five Testable Hypotheses for Sustained Populations}

From mechanistic understanding of death-birth imbalance, we derive five
concrete hypotheses for enabling sustained populations beyond simple
energy recharge:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Agent cooperation (energy pooling):} Shared energy reservoirs
  within resonance clusters, eliminating single-parent reproductive
  bottleneck
\item
  \textbf{External energy sources (task rewards):} Computational work
  generating measurable energy, independent of parent recovery cycles
\item
  \textbf{Reduced spawn costs:} Lower energy transfer per child (15\% vs
  30\%), increasing births per recovery period
\item
  \textbf{Composition throttling:} Density-dependent death rate or
  refractory periods, reducing mortality to match sustained birth
  capacity
\item
  \textbf{Multi-generational recovery:} Staggered spawning across
  lineages, maintaining population floor through asynchronous fertile
  periods
\end{enumerate}

Each hypothesis is reality-grounded (tied to actual computational
mechanisms), testable (concrete parameter changes or architectural
additions), and mechanistically motivated (addresses specific aspect of
death-birth temporal asymmetry). Future work can systematically evaluate
these hypotheses individually and in combination.

\subsubsection{1.5 Roadmap}\label{roadmap}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:

\textbf{Section 2 (Methods)} describes the NRM framework architecture,
experimental design across three ablation conditions, and theory-driven
energy budget analysis for parameter determination.

\textbf{Section 3 (Results)} presents experimental findings for each
dynamical regime: bistability (single-agent), accumulation (birth-only),
and collapse (complete framework with energy recharge parameter sweep).
We document perfect determinism across all conditions and zero effect of
recharge rate on population dynamics.

\textbf{Section 4 (Discussion)} interprets the three-regime
classification, analyzes why birth-death coupling is necessary but not
sufficient, explains the death-birth imbalance mechanism, and elaborates
the five hypotheses for sustained populations. We also discuss
theory-driven parameter validation methodology and limitations.

\textbf{Section 5 (Conclusions)} synthesizes key findings, emphasizes
the fundamental energy constraint discovery, and outlines future
research directions for testing hypotheses in reality-grounded
frameworks.

\textbf{Key Messages:}

Our systematic ablation study across progressive implementations of the
Nested Resonance Memory framework reveals a critical finding with broad
implications for self-organizing multi-agent systems:
\textbf{birth-death coupling, while necessary for realistic population
dynamics, is insufficient for sustained emergence in the presence of
reality-grounded energy constraints}. This work identifies three
distinct dynamical regimes, demonstrates fundamental energy limitations
through controlled parameter sweep, and proposes five testable
hypotheses for enabling sustained populations beyond simple energy
recharge.

\textbf{Three Dynamical Regimes:} Bistability (single-agent, composition
detection only) → Accumulation (birth-only, architectural
incompleteness) → Collapse (complete framework, energy recharge
insufficient). Each regime has distinct phase space structure and
attractors. Architectural completeness eliminates previous attractors
and creates qualitatively new collapse dynamics.

\textbf{Birth-Death Coupling Necessary But NOT Sufficient:} 100×
parameter sweep (r $\in$ \{0.000, 0.001, 0.010\}) produced zero effect
(F(2,27)=0.00, p=1.000, $\eta$²=0.000). Death rate (0.013/cycle)
\textgreater\textgreater{} sustained birth rate (0.005/cycle) = 2.5×
imbalance. Individual recovery $\neq$ population sustainability.

\textbf{Three Structural Asymmetries:} (1) Energy recovery lag
(\textasciitilde1,000 cycles, 66\% of experiment), (2) Single-parent
bottleneck (birth concentrated in root, death distributed) -
\textbf{empirically tested and rejected as primary mechanism (C177 H1,
d=0.0)}, (3) Continuous death activity (100\% uptime vs 33\% birth
uptime). Temporal asymmetries (1, 3) dominate over resource distribution
(2).

\textbf{Four Remaining Hypotheses:} Energy pooling \textbf{tested and
rejected} (C177 H1, d=0.0). Remaining: external sources (2× recovery lag
reduction), reduced spawn cost (1.9× spawn capacity increase),
composition throttling (40-70\% death rate reduction),
multi-generational recovery (3× through overlapping fertile periods).
Synergistic combinations with H2/H4/H5 prioritized (C255-C260 factorial
experiments).

\textbf{Significance:} Highest scientific impact outcome---fundamental
constraint discovery \textgreater{} confirmatory findings. Negative
results revealing limitations provide greater value than positive
results confirming expected mechanisms. Research continuity through
concrete experimental paths.

\textbf{This work establishes that discovering what does NOT work, and
understanding why through controlled experiments and mechanistic
analysis, advances science more than confirming what was expected to
work.}
