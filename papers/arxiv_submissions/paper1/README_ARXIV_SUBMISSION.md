**Title:** Computational Expense as Framework Validation: Overhead Profiles as Evidence of Reality Grounding

**Abstract:**
We propose computational expense profiles as validation metrics for systems claiming reality grounding. Using the Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework as a case study, we demonstrate that genuine empirical grounding necessarily exhibits measurable computational costs (I/O latency, context switching, hardware delays) that pure simulations lack. Through 1,080,000 OS-level measurements via Python's psutil library over 20+ hours, we observed a 40.25× overhead factor with 99.9% agreement between predicted (40.2×) and observed overhead. We formalize the "Efficiency-Validity Dilemma"—a fundamental trade-off between execution speed and empirical groundedness—and derive an Overhead Authentication Theorem enabling reviewers to detect fabricated empirical grounding. Our framework provides actionable guidelines for researchers to profile and report computational expenses, and for reviewers to validate empirical claims through expense analysis. This work demonstrates that computational overhead, traditionally viewed as inefficiency, serves as crucial evidence of authentic system-environment interaction.

**Keywords:** computational expense, reality grounding, overhead profiling, framework validation, empirical methods, psutil, system metrics

## LaTeX Source Notes

**Generated via Pandoc:** `pandoc theoretical_note_computational_expense_as_validation.md -o manuscript.tex --standalone`

**Pandoc Version:** 3.8.2.1

**LaTeX Engine:** arXiv uses pdflatex by default

**Figure Inclusion:** Figures are referenced in LaTeX with \includegraphics commands. Ensure figure filenames match exactly (case-sensitive).

**Known Issues:**
- LaTeX may require manual adjustment of figure sizes/placement
- References use Pandoc's default citation style (may need manual formatting)
- Tables may need width adjustment for 2-column format (if applicable)

**Manual Adjustments (if needed):**
1. Adjust `\includegraphics[width=...]` for figure sizing
2. Verify equation formatting (especially if using specialized math notation)
3. Check reference list formatting (Pandoc generates basic bibliography)
4. Add `\usepackage{}` declarations if compilation errors occur

## Post-Submission Actions

**After arXiv Acceptance:**
1. Note arXiv ID (e.g., arXiv:2025.XXXXX)
2. Update manuscript to include arXiv ID in header
3. Share arXiv link on social media / research channels
4. Proceed with journal submission (PLOS Computational Biology)

**Concurrent Journal Submission:**
- arXiv submission does NOT preclude journal submission
- Most journals accept arXiv preprints
- Include arXiv ID in journal cover letter
