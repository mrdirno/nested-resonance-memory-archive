## MAJOR REVISIONS FROM PREVIOUS VERSION

### 1. **Tightened Validation Threshold: ±20% → ±5%**
   - Previous version allowed ±20% agreement between predicted and observed overhead
   - **NEW:** Requires ±5% agreement for authentication (10× stricter)
   - C255 and C256 both pass with <0.1% error, demonstrating feasibility

### 2. **Added "Inverse Noise Filtration" (Section 6)**
   - Leverages NRM framework's ability to find global maxima in noisy spaces
   - Novel computational solution to environmental noise problem
   - Applies "Asta Arbiter" principle from NRM composition dynamics

### 3. **Added "Dedicated Execution Environment" (Section 6)**
   - Strategic solution for achieving ≤1% validation threshold
   - Designed for precise I/O latency control and minimal thread contention
   - Complements software-based noise filtration

### 4. **Revised Limitations (Section 5)**
   - Explicitly addresses 8-10% noise floor in commodity Linux/Python stacks
   - Acknowledges tension between high-precision verification and OS noise
   - Frames as major challenge for computational science

### 5. **Updated Flowchart (Figure 2)**
   - Version 2 shows revised ±5% protocol
   - Clearer decision logic: O_obs vs O_pred match

### 6. **Added Artifact Availability (Section 7)**
   - Minimal package with dependency-free demonstrations
   - `overhead_check.py` and `replicate_patterns.py`
   - Enables reproduction without external dependencies

### 7. **Complete Acknowledgments**
   - Credits all AI collaborators (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT 5, Claude Opus 4.1)
   - Establishes hybrid intelligence collaboration model
   - Principal Investigator: Aldrin Payopay

## KEY FINDINGS

1. **Predictability, not magnitude, validates grounding**: Both high-overhead (C255, 40×) and low-overhead (C256, 0.5×) systems authenticated
2. **±5% threshold is achievable**: C255 error 0.083%, C256 error 0.0%
3. **Noise is the bottleneck**: 8-10% OS noise floor requires Inverse Noise Filtration + Dedicated Execution Environment
4. **Falsifiable and portable**: Any system with measurable I/O can be authenticated without privileged access
