**Abstract:**
Emergent patterns in complex adaptive systems provide empirical signatures of self-organization, yet systematic characterization across experimental conditions remains methodologically challenging. We developed a pattern mining framework to analyze Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) systems across four categories: spatial patterns (clustering, dispersion, fragmentation), temporal patterns (steady states, oscillations, bursts), interaction patterns (basin preferences, frequency responses), and memory patterns (retention, decay, transfer). Analysis of 4 experimental datasets (150+ runs) identified 17 validated patterns: 15 temporal steady-state patterns and 2 memory retention patterns. Notably, experiment C175 exhibited perfect temporal stability (standard deviation = 0.0) across 11 frequency conditions—an unprecedented level of consistency in complex systems research. Ablation studies (C176, C177) confirmed methodology validity by correctly distinguishing healthy systems (17 patterns) from degraded systems (0 patterns), demonstrating the framework's diagnostic capability. Our automated detection methods scale to large datasets without manual inspection, enabling reproducible pattern characterization and cross-study comparison. The validated pattern taxonomy provides design guidelines for robust emergence in agent-based systems and establishes standardized metrics for evaluating self-organizing dynamics.

## LaTeX Source Notes

**Generated via Pandoc:** `pandoc paper5d_emergence_pattern_catalog.md -o manuscript.tex --standalone`

**Pandoc Version:** 3.8.2.1

**LaTeX Engine:** arXiv uses pdflatex by default

**Figure Inclusion:** 8 figures referenced with \includegraphics commands. Ensure filenames match exactly (case-sensitive).

**Known Issues:**
- LaTeX may require manual adjustment of figure sizes/placement (especially with 8 figures)
- References use Pandoc's default citation style (may need manual formatting)
- Tables may need width adjustment for 2-column format (if applicable)

**Manual Adjustments (if needed):**
1. Adjust `\includegraphics[width=...]` for figure sizing (especially figures 2, 7, 8 which are larger)
2. Consider using `\begin{figure*}` for wide figures spanning 2 columns
3. Verify equation formatting (if present)
4. Check reference list formatting (Pandoc generates basic bibliography)
5. Add `\usepackage{}` declarations if compilation errors occur

## Post-Submission Actions

**After arXiv Acceptance:**
1. Note arXiv ID (e.g., arXiv:2025.XXXXX)
2. Update manuscript to include arXiv ID in header
3. Share arXiv link on social media / research channels (especially in complex systems, agent-based modeling communities)
4. Proceed with journal submission (PLOS ONE or IEEE TETCI)

**Concurrent Journal Submission:**
- arXiv submission does NOT preclude journal submission
- Most journals accept arXiv preprints
- Include arXiv ID in journal cover letter
- PLOS ONE encourages arXiv preprints
