**Cross-list Categories:** cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multiagent Systems)

## MAJOR REVISIONS FROM PREVIOUS VERSION

### 1. **RESCOPED: 4 Categories → 2 Categories**
   - **REMOVED:** Spatial patterns and Interaction patterns (deferred to future work)
   - **RETAINED:** Temporal Stability and Memory Retention (17 validated patterns)
   - **Rationale:** Focus on categories with positive detections in current datasets
   - This is the most significant revision - entire paper refocused

### 2. **Added Replicability Criterion (Section 2)**
   - **NEW:** Requires pattern detection in ≥80% of k independent runs (k ≥ 20)
   - Eliminates false positives from single-run noise
   - Strengthens methodological rigor significantly
   - C175: 100% pass rate (20/20 runs), C171: 90% pass rate (18/20 runs)

### 3. **Added Noise-Aware Threshold Calibration (Section 2)**
   - **NEW:** Thresholds set at μ + 2σ from control data
   - Captures upper tail of noise under near-Gaussian assumption
   - Can be replaced with robust measures (MAD, quantiles) for skewed distributions
   - Grounds detector in robust statistics

### 4. **Added Generalizability Protocol for C255 (Section 3.5)**
   - Pre-registered hold-out test with frozen thresholds
   - Requires k=20 runs and ≥80% replicability
   - Detector can abstain if criterion not met
   - Treats both positive and negative outcomes as informative

### 5. **Updated Figures (7 instead of 8)**
   - Figure 1: **Focused taxonomy** (Temporal + Memory only, not 4 categories)
   - Figure 8: **Workflow v2** (rescoped to 2-category pipeline)
   - Removed former Figure 5 (likely spatial/interaction-related)
   - All remaining figures updated for consistency

### 6. **Revised Limitations (Section 5)**
   - Acknowledges small calibration dataset (C171, C175, C176, C177)
   - Notes μ + 2σ assumes approximate normality
   - Discusses sensitivity-reliability trade-off of ≥80% criterion
   - Explicitly defers spatial/interaction to future work

### 7. **Added Artifact Availability (Section 6)**
   - Minimal package with dependency-free demonstrations
   - `overhead_check.py` and `replicate_patterns.py`
   - Enables reproduction without external dependencies

### 8. **Complete Acknowledgments**
   - Credits all AI collaborators (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT 5, Claude Opus 4.1)
   - Establishes hybrid intelligence collaboration model
   - Principal Investigator: Aldrin Payopay

## KEY FINDINGS

1. **Rescoped to validated categories**: 17 patterns (15 temporal, 2 memory) across healthy runs; 0 across degraded
2. **Replicability strengthens findings**: C175 temporal stability passes in 100% of runs (20/20)
3. **Noise-aware thresholds**: μ + 2σ calibration captures upper tail of measurement noise
4. **Perfect stability is not a bug**: C175 σ=0.0 represents dynamic equilibrium with micro-level activity
5. **Generalizability protocol**: Pre-registered C255 test with frozen thresholds and replicability criterion

## SCOPE CLARIFICATION

### What This Paper Claims:
✅ **Temporal Stability patterns** detected and validated (15 patterns)
✅ **Memory Retention patterns** detected and validated (2 patterns)
✅ **Replicability criterion** strengthens methodology (≥80% of k≥20 runs)
✅ **Noise-aware thresholds** grounded in robust statistics (μ + 2σ)

### What This Paper Does NOT Claim:
❌ **Spatial patterns** - No positive detections, deferred to future work
❌ **Interaction patterns** - No positive detections, deferred to future work
❌ **Four-category framework** - Rescoped to two validated categories only

This rescoping represents a **strengthening**, not weakening, of the contribution. By focusing only on validated pattern categories, we avoid overclaiming and ensure reproducibility.
