## 4.X Energy Constraints in Complete Framework Dynamics

### 4.X.1 Discovery of Energy Limitation

Investigation of C176 V2 results (BASELINE mean_population=0.49, CV=101%) revealed an unexpected constraint absent in previous experiments: **energy depletion preventing sustained spawning in complete birth-death coupled systems**.

While C171 appeared to maintain stable populations (~17 agents at experiment end), detailed analysis uncovered that **C171 lacked the decomposition/death mechanism** entirely (Section X.X). C171 detected composition events but did not remove agents from the population, creating an accumulation regime rather than true birth-death coupling.

**C176 V2 correctly implemented both birth and death** mechanisms, revealing energy constraints that accumulation-only dynamics could mask.

### 4.X.2 Theoretical Analysis of Energy Depletion

The FractalAgent energy model derives from reality-grounded system metrics:

#### **Initial Energy Allocation**

```python
# At agent creation
cpu_percent = reality.get_system_metrics()['cpu_percent']
memory_percent = reality.get_system_metrics()['memory_percent']

initial_energy = (100 - cpu_percent) + (100 - memory_percent)
```

**Typical Range**: E₀ ≈ 120-140 (depending on system load)

#### **Energy Transfer During Spawning**

```python
# Parent spawns child (spawn_child method)
if parent.energy < 10.0:
    return None  # Cannot spawn

child_energy = parent.energy × 0.30  # Child receives 30%
parent.energy -= child_energy        # Parent loses energy
```

**Consequence**: Each spawn reduces parent energy by 30%

#### **Energy Decay Over Time**

```python
# Per evolve() cycle
energy_decay = 0.01 × delta_time  # delta_time = 0.01
energy -= energy_decay             # Loses ~0.0001/cycle
```

**Rate**: Negligible compared to spawn cost

#### **Spawn Capacity Calculation**

Starting with E₀ = 130:

| Spawn # | Energy Before | Energy Transfer | Energy After | Can Spawn? |
|---------|--------------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| 0       | 130.0        | —              | 130.0        | ✓ (>10)    |
| 1       | 130.0        | 39.0 (30%)     | 91.0         | ✓          |
| 2       | 91.0         | 27.3 (30%)     | 63.7         | ✓          |
| 3       | 63.7         | 19.1 (30%)     | 44.6         | ✓          |
| 4       | 44.6         | 13.4 (30%)     | 31.2         | ✓          |
| 5       | 31.2         | 9.4 (30%)      | 21.8         | ✓          |
| 6       | 21.8         | 6.5 (30%)      | 15.3         | ✓          |
| 7       | 15.3         | 4.6 (30%)      | 10.7         | ✓          |
| 8       | 10.7         | 3.2 (30%)      | 7.5          | **✗ (<10)** |

**Result**: Each agent can spawn **~7-8 children** before becoming sterile.

### 4.X.3 Population Dynamics Under Energy Constraint

**Implication for Birth-Death Coupled Systems**:

In C176 V2 (no energy recharge):
1. **Root agent** spawns offspring (generation 1)
2. After ~7-8 spawns, **root becomes sterile** (energy < 10)
3. **Generation 1 agents** can spawn generation 2
4. But composition events **remove agents** through clustering
5. If removal rate > spawn rate → **population collapses**

**Observed C176 V2 BASELINE**:
- spawn_count = 75 (births over 3000 cycles)
- composition_events = 38 (many led to multi-agent removals)
- Death rate >> birth rate
- mean_population = 0.49 (oscillating collapse/recovery)

**Contrast with C171 (no death)**:
- spawn_count = 60
- composition_events = 3038 (detection only, no removal)
- Population accumulates until spawn failures
- final_agent_count = 16-20 (endpoint, not equilibrium)

### 4.X.4 Reality-Grounded Energy Recharge Mechanism

To enable sustained populations in complete birth-death systems, we implemented **reality-grounded energy recharge** in the FractalAgent.evolve() method (Cycle 215 framework enhancement).

#### **Biological Motivation**

Natural organisms continuously absorb energy from their environment:
- **Metabolism**: Conversion of nutrients to cellular energy
- **Photosynthesis**: Light energy → chemical energy
- **Resource foraging**: Active energy acquisition

Pure energy depletion without recharge is biologically unrealistic for long-lived systems.

#### **Implementation**

```python
def evolve(self, delta_time: float) -> None:
    # Energy dissipation (entropy)
    energy_decay = 0.01 × delta_time  # ~0.0001/cycle

    # Energy recharge from reality (absorbed from available resources)
    if self.reality is not None:
        current_metrics = self.reality.get_system_metrics()
        available_capacity = (100 - current_metrics['cpu_percent']) + \\
                            (100 - current_metrics['memory_percent'])
        energy_recharge = 0.001 × available_capacity × delta_time
    else:
        energy_recharge = 0.001 × delta_time  # Fallback

    # Net energy change
    self.energy = self.energy - energy_decay + energy_recharge
    self.energy = max(0.0, min(200.0, self.energy))  # Cap at 200
```

#### **Recharge Rate Analysis**

**Typical system** (CPU=46%, Memory=52%):
```
available_capacity = (100-46) + (100-52) = 54 + 48 = 102
energy_recharge = 0.001 × 102 × 0.01 = 0.00102 ≈ 0.001/cycle
```

**Over 100 cycles**: +0.1 energy
**Over 1000 cycles**: +1.0 energy
**To recover spawn threshold (10)**: ~10,000 cycles

**Recharge/Decay Ratio**: 0.001 / 0.0001 = **10×** (recharge dominates)

Wait, this calculation reveals the issue: at 0.001/cycle, it would take **10,000 cycles** to recover 10 energy. With only 3000 cycles total, agents can't recover enough to re-spawn.

**[CRITICAL NOTE FOR REVISION]**: The energy recharge rate may be too low! Current implementation:
```python
energy_recharge = 0.001 * available_capacity * delta_time  # ~0.001/cycle
```

Should potentially be:
```python
energy_recharge = 0.01 * available_capacity * delta_time  # ~1.0/cycle
```

This would give ~100 energy over 100 cycles, enabling recovery to spawn threshold.

**[ACTION ITEM]**: Check C176 V3 recharge rate in implementation. If still 0.001, may explain why V3 might fail.

Actually, let me recalculate from the code I wrote:
```python
energy_recharge = 0.001 * available_capacity * delta_time
                = 0.001 * 102 * 0.01
                = 0.00102 per evolve() call
```

Each cycle calls evolve() once with delta_time=0.01, so:
- Per cycle: 0.00102 ≈ 0.001
- Per 100 cycles: 0.1
- Per 1000 cycles: 1.0

To recover 10 energy (spawn threshold): 10,000 cycles

**But wait** - available_capacity is ~100, and I wrote in the comment "~0.12-0.14/cycle". Let me recalculate:

```python
available_capacity = 102
delta_time = 0.01
energy_recharge = 0.001 * 102 * 0.01 = 0.00102
```

That's 0.001/cycle, not 0.12. My comment was wrong!

**CRITICAL ERROR IN IMPLEMENTATION**: The recharge rate is 100× too low!

Should be:
```python
energy_recharge = 0.1 * available_capacity * delta_time  # ~10/cycle? No, too high
```

Or more reasonably:
```python
energy_recharge = 0.01 * available_capacity * delta_time
                = 0.01 * 102 * 0.01
                = 0.0102 per cycle
                = ~1.0 per 100 cycles
                = ~10 per 1000 cycles
```

This would allow recovery to spawn threshold in ~1000 cycles, enabling multi-generational spawning.

**[URGENT]**: C176 V3 is likely running with 0.001 recharge rate (100× too low). This means C176 V3 will probably FAIL due to insufficient recharge.

Need to:
1. Let C176 V3 finish (almost 7 min in, committed to this run)
2. Check results
3. If failed, create C176 V4 with corrected recharge rate (0.01 instead of 0.001)
4. Document this discovery

This is actually a valuable finding - demonstrates importance of parameter scaling!

### 4.X.5 Parameter Sensitivity and Scaling

[TO BE WRITTEN based on C176 V3 results]

**Key Question**: What recharge rate is sufficient for sustained populations?

**Hypothesis**: Recharge rate must match or exceed average spawn rate to maintain population.

**Tested Values** (pending):
- C176 V2: 0.0 (no recharge) → Collapse (mean_pop=0.49)
- C176 V3: 0.001 × capacity × dt → [PENDING]
- C176 V4: 0.01 × capacity × dt → [FUTURE TEST]

### 4.X.6 Biological and Computational Parallels

**Energy Constraints in Natural Systems**:

Biological populations face similar energy constraints:
- **Metabolic cost**: Reproduction requires substantial energy
- **Carrying capacity**: Environment limits total population
- **Resource depletion**: Over-exploitation leads to collapse
- **Boom-bust cycles**: Oscillating populations when birth/death imbalanced

**Computational Resource Constraints**:

Analogous limits in computational systems:
- **Memory budget**: Each agent requires memory allocation
- **CPU capacity**: Processing time limits agent operations
- **Bandwidth limits**: Communication between agents
- **Energy efficiency**: Real systems have power constraints

**NRM Framework Grounding**:

The energy model connects theoretical dynamics to physical reality:
- Energy from actual CPU/memory availability (psutil metrics)
- Spawn costs represent computational overhead
- Recharge represents resource recycling/recovery
- Population collapse mirrors resource exhaustion

This grounding ensures NRM framework predictions are **physically realizable**, not pure mathematical abstractions.
