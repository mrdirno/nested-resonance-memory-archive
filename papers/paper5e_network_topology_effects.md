## ABSTRACT (Draft)

**Background:** Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) systems rely on agent interactions for composition-decomposition dynamics. Network topology—the structure of who-connects-to-whom—may significantly influence pattern emergence, yet this dimension remains unexplored in NRM research.

**Methods:** We systematically varied network topologies (fully connected, random, small-world, scale-free, lattice) while holding other parameters constant (population=100, frequency=2.5 Hz, baseline configuration). Pattern mining tools from Paper 5D were applied to detect how topology affects pattern types, frequencies, and stability.

**Results:** [To be determined after experiments] Hypothesis: Scale-free networks exhibit highest pattern diversity (hubs facilitate composition events). Small-world networks show moderate diversity with high stability (local clustering + global shortcuts). Regular lattices show lowest diversity (limited long-range coordination).

**Conclusions:** [To be determined] If topology-dependent: Network structure is critical design parameter. If topology-invariant: NRM patterns robust to connectivity architecture, validating universality.

**Keywords:** Network topology, graph theory, agent-based modeling, nested resonance memory, composition-decomposition dynamics, scale-free networks, small-world networks

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Network Topology in Complex Systems
- Network science foundations (Barabási, Watts-Strogatz)
- Topology effects on dynamics (synchronization, epidemics, opinion formation)
- Small-world phenomenon (high clustering + short paths)
- Scale-free networks (power-law degree distributions)
- Lattice structures (regular, spatial constraints)

### 1.2 Network Topology in NRM Framework
**Theoretical Consideration:** NRM agents interact to form composition clusters. Network topology constrains which agents can interact directly.

**Key Question:** Do NRM patterns emerge robustly regardless of topology (universal), or does connectivity structure matter?

**Hypotheses:**
1. **Scale-Free Networks:** Hub agents facilitate composition events → higher pattern diversity
2. **Small-World Networks:** Local clustering + global shortcuts → moderate diversity, high stability
3. **Random Networks:** Variable connectivity → moderate diversity, variable stability
4. **Regular Lattices:** Spatial constraints limit long-range coordination → lower diversity
5. **Fully Connected:** No constraints (baseline) → highest pattern potential but coordination challenges

### 1.3 Research Question
**Primary:** How does network topology affect NRM emergent patterns?

**Sub-questions:**
1. Do different topologies produce different pattern types?
2. Is pattern stability affected by network structure?
3. Are there optimal topologies for specific pattern classes?
4. Can topology compensate for suboptimal parameters?

### 1.4 Contributions
1. **First systematic study** of topology effects in NRM systems
2. **Topology-pattern mapping** across 5 network structures
3. **Optimal topology identification** for pattern emergence
4. **Design guidelines** for NRM network architecture
5. **Robustness analysis** testing universality vs. topology-dependence

## 2. METHODS

### 2.1 Network Topologies Tested

#### 2.1.1 Fully Connected (Baseline)
- **Structure:** Every agent connects to every other agent
- **Degree:** N-1 for all nodes (where N=100)
- **Properties:** No constraints, maximum coordination potential
- **Purpose:** Baseline reference (current NRM experiments use this)

#### 2.1.2 Random (Erdős-Rényi)
- **Structure:** Edges added randomly with probability p
- **Degree:** Poisson distribution, mean = p(N-1)
- **Properties:** Variable connectivity, no special structure
- **Purpose:** Test effects of random connectivity vs. fully connected

**Parameters to test:** p = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5] (10%, 30%, 50% connectivity)

#### 2.1.3 Small-World (Watts-Strogatz)
- **Structure:** Start with ring lattice, rewire edges with probability β
- **Degree:** Approximately constant (k neighbors)
- **Properties:** High clustering coefficient + short average path length
- **Purpose:** Test local-global balance (biological networks often small-world)

**Parameters to test:** k=6, β = [0.01, 0.1, 0.5] (low, medium, high rewiring)

#### 2.1.4 Scale-Free (Barabási-Albert)
- **Structure:** Preferential attachment (rich-get-richer)
- **Degree:** Power-law distribution P(k) ~ k^(-γ)
- **Properties:** Hub nodes with high degree, most nodes low degree
- **Purpose:** Test hub effects on composition dynamics

**Parameters to test:** m = [2, 4, 6] (edges per new node)

#### 2.1.5 Regular Lattice (Grid)
- **Structure:** 2D grid with periodic boundary conditions (torus)
- **Degree:** Constant (4 neighbors in 2D grid)
- **Properties:** Spatial structure, local interactions only
- **Purpose:** Test spatial constraint effects (minimal long-range coordination)

**Parameters to test:** 2D grid (10×10)

### 2.2 Experimental Design

**Fixed Parameters:**
- Population: N = 100 agents (baseline)
- Frequency: 2.5 Hz (known stable regime)
- Configuration: Baseline (full NRM framework)
- Cycles: 5000 per experiment
- Seeds: 5 replications per topology configuration

**Total Conditions:**
- Fully connected: 1 topology × 5 seeds = 5 experiments
- Random: 3 configurations × 5 seeds = 15 experiments
- Small-world: 3 configurations × 5 seeds = 15 experiments
- Scale-free: 3 configurations × 5 seeds = 15 experiments
- Lattice: 1 topology × 5 seeds = 5 experiments
- **Total:** 55 experiments

**Runtime:** ~55 minutes (estimated 1 min per experiment)

### 2.3 Pattern Detection

**Apply Paper 5D Pattern Mining Framework:**
- Temporal patterns (steady state, oscillation, burst)
- Memory patterns (retention, decay, transfer)
- Spatial patterns (clustering, dispersion)
- Interaction patterns (basin preferences)

**Topology-Specific Metrics:**
1. **Pattern diversity:** Count unique pattern types per topology
2. **Pattern stability:** Compare stability scores across topologies
3. **Composition efficiency:** Composition events per topology
4. **Hub effects (scale-free only):** Correlation between hub degree and composition participation

### 2.4 Network Analysis

**Compute Topology Metrics:**
- Average path length (L)
- Clustering coefficient (C)
- Degree distribution statistics (mean, std, max)
- Small-world coefficient: σ = (C/C_random) / (L/L_random)

**Correlate with Pattern Metrics:**
- Does high clustering → higher memory retention?
- Does short path length → faster composition dynamics?
- Do hubs → higher pattern diversity?

## 3. RESULTS (Placeholder)

### 3.1 Pattern Diversity Across Topologies

**Hypothesis:** Scale-free > Small-world > Random > Lattice > Fully connected

**Expected Results:**
| Topology | Patterns Expected | Patterns Observed | Diversity Rank |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Fully connected | ~17 (baseline) | TBD | TBD |
| Scale-free (m=4) | ~20-25 (higher) | TBD | TBD |
| Small-world (β=0.1) | ~15-20 | TBD | TBD |
| Random (p=0.3) | ~12-15 | TBD | TBD |
| Lattice | ~8-12 (lower) | TBD | TBD |

### 3.2 Temporal Stability Across Topologies

**Hypothesis:** Small-world networks show highest stability (local clustering buffers against perturbations)

**Expected Results:**
- Small-world: Stability ≈ 400-600 (highest)
- Fully connected: Stability ≈ 200-400 (baseline)
- Scale-free: Stability ≈ 150-300 (variable, depends on hubs)
- Random: Stability ≈ 100-250 (variable)
- Lattice: Stability ≈ 50-150 (lowest, limited coordination)

### 3.3 Hub Effects in Scale-Free Networks

**Hypothesis:** Agents with high degree (hubs) disproportionately participate in composition events

**Expected Analysis:**
- Compute degree for each agent
- Track composition event participation
- Correlation: degree vs. composition frequency
- Expected: Positive correlation (r > 0.5)

**Interpretation:** If hubs drive composition, scale-free networks may enable efficient pattern formation with fewer highly-connected agents.

### 3.4 Optimal Topology for Pattern Classes

**Hypothesis:** Different pattern types favor different topologies

**Expected Mapping:**
- **Temporal steady-state:** Small-world (stability + coordination)
- **Memory retention:** Small-world (local clustering preserves patterns)
- **Spatial clustering:** Lattice (spatial constraints promote clustering)
- **Burst patterns:** Scale-free (hubs trigger cascades)

## 4. DISCUSSION (Placeholder)

### 4.1 Topology-Pattern Relationships

**If topology-dependent (hypothesis confirmed):**
- Network structure is critical NRM design parameter
- Different topologies optimize different pattern classes
- Design guidelines: Match topology to desired patterns
  - Want stability? → Small-world
  - Want diversity? → Scale-free
  - Want spatial organization? → Lattice

**If topology-invariant (hypothesis refuted):**
- NRM patterns robust to connectivity architecture
- Validates universality of composition-decomposition dynamics
- Design implication: Topology doesn't matter (simplifies implementation)

### 4.2 Small-World as Optimal Architecture?

**If small-world shows highest stability + moderate diversity:**
- Biological inspiration validated (brains are small-world)
- High clustering preserves local patterns
- Short paths enable global coordination
- Design recommendation: Default to small-world for NRM systems

### 4.3 Scale-Free Hub Effects

**If hubs drive composition events:**
- Power-law dynamics in NRM (few agents do most work)
- Robustness-fragility tradeoff (resilient to random failures, vulnerable to targeted hub removal)
- Design consideration: Protect hub agents for system stability

**If no hub effects:**
- Composition distributed equally regardless of degree
- Scale-free topology offers no advantage
- Design implication: Simpler topologies sufficient

### 4.4 Lattice Spatial Constraints

**If lattices show different pattern types:**
- Spatial structure enables spatial patterns (currently 0 detected in fully connected)
- May require different metrics (spatial autocorrelation)
- Design implication: Use lattices for spatially-structured problems
