## arXiv Account Setup (User Action Required)

### 1. Create arXiv Account (if not already registered)

**URL:** https://arxiv.org/user/login

**Steps:**
1. Click "Create Account"
2. Provide email address (aldrin.gdf@gmail.com)
3. Verify email
4. Complete profile information
5. Link ORCID ID (if you have one)

**Note:** First-time submitters require **endorsement** for most categories. See "Endorsement Requirements" section below.

### 2. Endorsement Requirements

arXiv requires endorsement for first submission to most categories:

**Paper 1 (cs.DC):**
- If you don't have endorsement for cs.DC, you'll need an endorser
- Request endorsement from colleagues in distributed computing field
- Or use "Request Endorsement" button during submission

**Paper 5D (nlin.AO):**
- If you don't have endorsement for nlin.AO, you'll need an endorser
- Request endorsement from colleagues in nonlinear dynamics/complex systems
- Or use "Request Endorsement" button during submission

**Endorsement Process:**
- arXiv will email potential endorsers from the relevant field
- Usually takes 1-3 days
- Once endorsed for a category, future submissions don't require re-endorsement

**Alternative:** If you have a colleague with arXiv endorsement authority, ask them directly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: LaTeX Won't Compile

**Solution:**
- Check that all figures are referenced correctly (`\includegraphics{figureX}`)
- Ensure no special packages that arXiv doesn't support
- Test compilation locally with vanilla TeXLive before submitting

### Issue: Figures Not Appearing

**Solution:**
- Verify all PNG files are uploaded
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure figures are in same directory as .tex file

### Issue: Need Endorsement

**Solution:**
- Use "Request Endorsement" button during submission
- Or email colleagues with endorsement authority
- Include brief description of your work and GitHub link
- Usually resolved within 1-3 days

### Issue: Abstract Too Long

**Solution:**
- arXiv allows up to 1,920 characters
- Both papers are well within limit
- If needed, condense by removing less critical details

## Submission Timeline Summary

### Paper 1 (cs.DC)
- **Preparation:** ✅ Complete
- **User Action:** Submit to arXiv (~30 min)
- **arXiv Processing:** 1-2 days
- **Result:** Public arXiv posting
- **Next Step:** Submit to PLOS Computational Biology

### Paper 5D (nlin.AO)
- **Preparation:** ✅ Complete
- **User Action:** Submit to arXiv (~30 min)
- **arXiv Processing:** 1-2 days
- **Result:** Public arXiv posting
- **Next Step:** Submit to journal (TBD)

### Recommended Approach

**Option 1: Submit Both Simultaneously**
- Advantage: Both papers public on same day
- Disadvantage: More work upfront

**Option 2: Submit Sequentially**
- Submit Paper 1 first (cs.DC)
- After Paper 1 posted, submit Paper 5D
- Advantage: Easier to manage
- Disadvantage: Papers posted on different days

**Recommendation:** Submit both simultaneously if you have 60-90 minutes available. The process is straightforward and both papers can reference each other as "submitted alongside."
