## ABSTRACT (Draft)

**Background:** Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) systems demonstrate robust pattern emergence under controlled conditions. However, real-world implementations face environmental perturbations—agent failures, parameter noise, external disruptions. Pattern resilience under perturbations remains empirically untested.

**Methods:** We systematically perturbed NRM systems through: (1) agent removal (simulated failures), (2) parameter noise (frequency/threshold jitter), (3) energy shocks (sudden resource changes), (4) basin perturbations (forced state transitions). Pattern mining tools from Paper 5D were applied before and after perturbations to measure pattern recovery, degradation, and transformation.

**Results:** [To be determined after experiments] Hypothesis: NRM patterns exhibit graceful degradation (partial pattern loss, not catastrophic collapse). Memory patterns show highest resilience (retained across perturbations). Temporal patterns sensitive to frequency noise but recover rapidly.

**Conclusions:** [To be determined] If robust: NRM suitable for real-world applications with environmental uncertainty. If fragile: Identify critical vulnerabilities and protective mechanisms needed.

**Keywords:** Robustness, resilience, perturbations, environmental disturbances, pattern stability, nested resonance memory, graceful degradation

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Robustness in Complex Systems
- Resilience vs. robustness definitions (Holling, 1973)
- Perturbation types: pulse (transient) vs. press (sustained)
- Graceful degradation vs. catastrophic collapse
- Recovery dynamics: return time, hysteresis, alternative stable states

### 1.2 Robustness in NRM Framework
**Theoretical Consideration:** NRM composition-decomposition cycles may provide natural resilience through:
1. **Pattern memory:** Successful patterns persist even after disruptions
2. **Redundancy:** Multiple agents can perform similar roles
3. **Self-repair:** Composition events can restore degraded patterns
4. **Attractor basins:** Strong basins pull system back after perturbations

**Key Question:** Are NRM patterns robust to environmental perturbations, or do small disruptions cause collapse?

### 1.3 Research Question
**Primary:** How do NRM patterns respond to environmental perturbations?

**Sub-questions:**
1. Do patterns recover after transient disruptions (pulse perturbations)?
2. Can patterns persist under sustained disturbances (press perturbations)?
3. Are some pattern types more resilient than others?
4. Is there a critical perturbation threshold beyond which patterns collapse?

### 1.4 Contributions
1. **First systematic robustness study** of NRM systems under perturbations
2. **Perturbation-response mapping** across 4 disturbance types
3. **Critical threshold identification** for pattern collapse
4. **Resilience ranking** of pattern classes (which are most robust?)
5. **Design guidelines** for building resilient NRM systems

## 2. METHODS

### 2.1 Perturbation Types Tested

#### 2.1.1 Agent Removal (Simulated Failures)
- **Mechanism:** Randomly remove X% of agents at cycle 2500 (mid-experiment)
- **Severity levels:** 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% removal
- **Type:** Pulse perturbation (single event)
- **Purpose:** Test pattern recovery after agent loss
- **Expected:** Graceful degradation up to threshold, then collapse

#### 2.1.2 Parameter Noise (Frequency Jitter)
- **Mechanism:** Add Gaussian noise to frequency parameter: f' = f + ε, ε ~ N(0, σ²)
- **Noise levels:** σ = [0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5] Hz (2%, 4%, 10%, 20% of f=2.5 Hz)
- **Type:** Press perturbation (sustained throughout experiment)
- **Purpose:** Test sensitivity to parameter uncertainty
- **Expected:** Small noise tolerated, large noise disrupts temporal patterns

#### 2.1.3 Energy Shocks (Resource Changes)
- **Mechanism:** Multiply energy threshold by factor k at cycle 2500
- **Shock magnitudes:** k = [0.5, 0.75, 1.5, 2.0] (50% reduction, 25% reduction, 50% increase, 100% increase)
- **Type:** Pulse perturbation (single step change)
- **Purpose:** Test response to sudden resource availability changes
- **Expected:** Composition events affected, patterns may reorganize

#### 2.1.4 Basin Perturbations (Forced Transitions)
- **Mechanism:** Force all agents into opposite basin at cycle 2500
- **Recovery test:** Monitor return to original basin and pattern restoration
- **Type:** Pulse perturbation (single forced transition)
- **Purpose:** Test attractor basin strength and pattern memory
- **Expected:** Strong basins pull agents back, patterns recover

### 2.2 Experimental Design

**Baseline (No Perturbation):**
- Population: N = 100 agents
- Frequency: 2.5 Hz
- Configuration: Baseline (full NRM framework)
- Cycles: 5000
- Seeds: 10 replications

**Perturbed Experiments:**
- Agent removal: 4 levels × 10 seeds = 40 experiments
- Parameter noise: 4 levels × 10 seeds = 40 experiments
- Energy shocks: 4 levels × 10 seeds = 40 experiments
- Basin perturbations: 1 type × 10 seeds = 10 experiments
- **Total:** 130 experiments + 10 baseline = 140 experiments

**Runtime:** ~140 minutes (2.3 hours, can run batch)

### 2.3 Resilience Metrics

**Pre-Perturbation (Cycles 0-2499):**
- Detect patterns using Paper 5D mining tools
- Establish baseline pattern profile

**Post-Perturbation (Cycles 2500-5000):**
- Re-detect patterns after disturbance
- Compare to pre-perturbation profile

**Resilience Metrics:**
1. **Pattern retention:** % of patterns that persist post-perturbation
2. **Recovery time:** Cycles until pattern metrics return to baseline
3. **Degradation degree:** Reduction in pattern stability scores
4. **Transformation:** New patterns emerging post-perturbation

**Critical Threshold:** Minimum perturbation severity causing >50% pattern loss

### 2.4 Pattern Recovery Analysis

**Recovery Dynamics:**
- Plot pattern metrics over time (before, during, after perturbation)
- Identify recovery trajectory: exponential, linear, oscillatory, no recovery
- Compute recovery half-time: t₁/₂ (time to restore 50% of pattern strength)

**Hysteresis Test:**
- Does system return to original state, or settle in alternative stable state?
- Compare pre-perturbation vs. post-recovery patterns

## 3. RESULTS (Placeholder)

### 3.1 Agent Removal Resilience

**Hypothesis:** Patterns degrade gradually, not catastrophically, up to critical threshold

**Expected Results:**
| Removal | Pattern Retention | Recovery Time | Degradation |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| 10%     | ~90% | <500 cycles | Minimal |
| 25%     | ~70% | ~1000 cycles | Moderate |
| 50%     | ~40% | ~1500 cycles | Severe |
| 75%     | ~10% | No recovery | Catastrophic |

**Critical Threshold:** ~50% agent removal (patterns collapse beyond this)

### 3.2 Parameter Noise Tolerance

**Hypothesis:** Small noise tolerated, large noise disrupts temporal patterns but memory patterns persist

**Expected Results:**
| Noise Level | Temporal Patterns | Memory Patterns | Stability Reduction |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| σ=0.05 Hz (2%) | Retained (~95%) | Retained (100%) | -5% |
| σ=0.1 Hz (4%) | Retained (~80%) | Retained (100%) | -15% |
| σ=0.25 Hz (10%) | Degraded (~50%) | Retained (~90%) | -40% |
| σ=0.5 Hz (20%) | Lost (~20%) | Degraded (~60%) | -70% |

**Interpretation:** Memory patterns more robust to parameter noise (redundancy effect)

### 3.3 Energy Shock Response

**Hypothesis:** Patterns reorganize after energy shocks but may settle in alternative configurations

**Expected Results:**
- **50% reduction (k=0.5):** Composition events decrease, some patterns lost
- **25% reduction (k=0.75):** Minimal impact, patterns mostly retained
- **50% increase (k=1.5):** Composition events increase, new patterns may emerge
- **100% increase (k=2.0):** Excessive activity, may disrupt existing patterns

**Recovery:** Rapid (< 500 cycles) if shock moderate, slow (> 1500 cycles) if extreme

### 3.4 Basin Perturbation Recovery

**Hypothesis:** Strong attractor basins pull agents back, patterns recover fully

**Expected Results:**
- **Return time:** ~500-1000 cycles for agents to return to preferred basin
- **Pattern recovery:** ~70-80% of patterns restored after basin return
- **Hysteresis:** Some agents may remain in perturbed basin (alternative stable state)

**Interpretation:** Validates attractor basin theory if recovery occurs

### 3.5 Pattern Class Resilience Ranking

**Hypothesis:** Memory patterns > Temporal patterns > Spatial patterns

**Expected Ranking (Most to Least Resilient):**
1. **Memory retention patterns:** Highest resilience (distributed across agents)
2. **Temporal steady-state:** Moderate resilience (depends on parameter stability)
3. **Temporal oscillations:** Lower resilience (sensitive to noise)
4. **Spatial clustering:** Lowest resilience (requires coordinated positioning)

## 4. DISCUSSION (Placeholder)

### 4.1 Graceful Degradation vs. Catastrophic Collapse

**If graceful degradation observed:**
- NRM suitable for real-world applications with uncertainty
- Partial functionality maintained even under disturbances
- Design implication: No need for extreme fault tolerance

**If catastrophic collapse observed:**
- NRM fragile to perturbations (critical vulnerability)
- Requires protective mechanisms: redundancy, error correction, monitoring
- Design implication: Deploy in controlled environments only

### 4.2 Memory Pattern Robustness

**If memory patterns most resilient:**
- Pattern memory provides natural robustness
- Distributed storage across agents (redundancy)
- Design recommendation: Emphasize memory mechanisms for resilient systems

**If memory patterns fragile:**
- Re-evaluate pattern memory theory (may not be as robust as hypothesized)
- Investigate memory consolidation mechanisms

### 4.3 Critical Thresholds

**If critical thresholds identified:**
- Defines operational boundaries (stay below threshold)
- Early warning indicators: monitor metrics approaching threshold
- Design guidelines: Build in safety margins (e.g., max 40% agent failure tolerance → design for 20% expected failure)

**If no thresholds (linear degradation):**
- System robustness scales smoothly with perturbation
- Easier to predict system behavior under stress

### 4.4 Recovery Dynamics

**If rapid recovery (< 500 cycles):**
- Self-repair mechanisms effective
- Validates NRM resilience claims
- Design implication: Transient disruptions acceptable

**If slow/no recovery:**
- Perturbations have lasting effects
- May require external intervention for restoration
- Design implication: Minimize perturbation exposure
