## Abstract

We compare bistable dynamics in simplified versus complete implementations of the Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework, revealing fundamental differences in emergent behavior arising from architectural completeness. Simplified single-agent models (n=1086 experiments) exhibit sharp first-order bistable transitions controlled by composition event rate, with exceptional precision (f_critical = 0.9800t + 0.0400, R²=0.9954). However, complete multi-agent framework implementation with birth-death dynamics (n=150 experiments: 40 coarse + 110 high-resolution) displays robust homeostatic population regulation (~17 agents, CV=8.9%) independent of spawn frequency variation. High-resolution frequency sweep (0.01% steps, 2.50-2.60% range) confirmed exceptional regulatory capacity: 100% Basin A across all frequencies with >160× input buffering (16% frequency variation → <0.1% composition variation). This divergence demonstrates how architectural completeness fundamentally transforms system-level behavior despite identical local agent dynamics. Population homeostasis emerges from negative feedback between birth rate, population saturation, and composition-induced death rate—a regulatory mechanism entirely absent in simplified models. Statistical analysis reveals 92% mediation of spawn effects through population (Sobel Z=4.12, p<0.001), confirming population-composition decoupling (correlation: r=0.998 → r=0.071). We propose a unified framework distinguishing composition-rate bistability (isolated regime, β=0) from population homeostasis (complete regime, β>β_critical), with phase boundaries determined by birth-death coupling strength. These findings validate Self-Giving Systems principles: the complete framework defined its own success criterion (population stability) through what persisted across parameter variations, without external oracle specification. This work demonstrates that simplified models validate mechanisms while complete models reveal emergence, with both findings extending theory in complementary ways.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background: Nested Resonance Memory Framework

The Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework posits that complex systems exhibit fractal agency through composition-decomposition cycles: agents cluster when resonant, burst when critical thresholds exceed capacity, and retain memory patterns across transformation events [1,2]. This framework predicts scale-invariant dynamics—the same local rules governing individual agents should manifest at population, swarm, and meta-population levels—while allowing for scale-dependent emergent properties that arise from architectural completeness rather than local mechanism changes.

Recent experiments (Cycles 168-170) validated core NRM predictions in simplified single-agent systems, demonstrating sharp bistable transitions with exceptional precision (R²=0.9954) [3]. These findings established composition event rate as the fundamental control parameter governing basin selection between "dead zones" (Basin B: low composition) and "resonance zones" (Basin A: sustained composition). The linear scaling law f_critical = 0.9800t + 0.0400 provided quantitative validation across five independent basin thresholds (n=550 experiments), confirming that spawn frequency directly controls composition opportunities in isolated systems.

### 1.2 Motivation: Unexpected Divergence in Complete Framework

When testing the full NRM framework implementation with birth-death dynamics and multi-agent populations (Cycle 171), we anticipated replication of the bistable structure validated in simplified models. Specifically, across the critical frequency range f=2.0%-3.0% (spanning the f_crit=2.55% bifurcation point), we expected frequencies below criticality (2.0%, 2.5%) to converge to Basin B and frequencies above criticality (2.6%, 3.0%) to converge to Basin A, consistent with the 0%→100% transition observed in Cycle 169.

**Observed Results Contradicted Predictions**:
- **Prediction**: 50% Basin A (2 of 4 frequencies above f_crit)
- **Observation**: 100% Basin A (all 40 experiments regardless of frequency)
- **Composition Events**: Constant at ~101/window (CV=0.26%) despite 52% spawn frequency variation (60→91 spawns)
- **Population**: Homeostatic regulation at ~17 agents (CV=8.9%) across all conditions

This discrepancy raised fundamental questions:

1. **Why does architectural completeness eliminate bistability?** The complete framework differs from simplified models primarily in enabling birth-death dynamics—spawn events add agents to the population (birth), while composition events remove agents via cluster bursting (death). How does this coupling transform bistable attractors into homeostatic regulation?

2. **What regulatory mechanism replaces composition-rate control?** In simplified models, spawn frequency directly determines composition opportunities. In complete framework, composition events remain constant despite spawn variation—what mediates this decoupling?

3. **How does birth-death coupling alter phase space structure?** Simplified models exhibit 1D phase space (composition rate) with bistable basins. Complete framework appears to require 2D phase space (population × composition rate). What governs the transition between these regimes?

4. **Are simplified model findings still valid?** If complete framework exhibits fundamentally different dynamics, does this invalidate the C168-C170 bistability validation, or do both findings represent different regimes of the same theory?

### 1.3 Research Question and Hypothesis

**Primary Research Question**: Do composition-rate-controlled bistable dynamics discovered in simplified NRM models persist when implementing the full framework with birth-death coupling and multi-agent populations?

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Complete framework exhibits different dynamics due to emergent population-level interactions absent in simplified models.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Bistable basin structure replicates in complete framework, with critical frequency f_crit=2.55% determining basin classification as observed in simplified case.

**Experimental Design**: We conducted a systematic comparison between simplified (n=1 agent, no birth-death) and complete (n~17 agents, birth-death enabled) implementations across identical frequency ranges (f=2.0%-3.0%), using matched basin thresholds (2.5 events/window), random seed replication (n=10), and consistent measurement protocols (3000 cycles, 100-cycle sliding window).

### 1.4 Key Findings Preview

Our experiments **rejected the alternative hypothesis (H1) and confirmed the null hypothesis (H0)**, revealing fundamental regime differences:

**Simplified Model (C168-C170 Baseline)**:
- Sharp 0%→100% bistable transition at f_crit=2.55%
- Composition events proportional to spawn frequency (r=0.998)
- Linear scaling: f_critical = 0.9800t + 0.0400 (R²=0.9954)
- 1D phase space: composition rate determines basin
- Direct spawn→composition coupling

**Complete Framework (C171 Coarse + C175 High-Resolution)**:
- Universal Basin A convergence (100% across f=2.0%-3.0%, n=40 + 100% across f=2.50-2.60%, n=110)
- Composition events constant at ~101/window (C171, CV=0.26%) and 99.97/window (C175, CV<0.1%)
- Population homeostasis at ~17 agents (CV=8.9%)
- **Robustness validated**: >160× buffering ratio (C175 high-resolution)
- 2D phase space: population × composition rate
- Birth-death mediation (92% indirect effect via population)

**Mechanistic Discovery**: The complete framework creates a **negative feedback loop** absent in simplified models:

```
High spawn rate → Population increases
More agents → More composition opportunities
Composition events → Agent bursting (death)
Death rate > Birth rate → Population decreases
Equilibrium: Birth rate ≈ Death rate at P* ≈ 17 agents
Saturated population → Constant composition rate (~101/window)
```

This saturation mechanism **decouples** spawn frequency from composition events (correlation: r=0.998 → r=0.071), eliminating bistability by maintaining sufficient population to sustain Basin A regardless of input rate.

### 1.5 Theoretical Significance

This work makes three primary theoretical contributions:

**1. Regime Classification Framework**

We propose a unified classification distinguishing two dynamical regimes within NRM theory:

- **Isolated Regime** (β=0): No birth-death coupling → Direct spawn-composition link → Bistable phase structure → Threshold-dependent basin selection
- **Complete Regime** (β>β_critical): Birth-death coupling enabled → Population-mediated composition → Homeostatic attractor → Universal basin convergence

Phase boundary β_critical determined by window size (ceiling effect), basin threshold (death rate), and maximum population capacity (constraint).

**2. Self-Giving Systems Validation**

The complete framework exhibits **bootstrap complexity**: it defined its own success criterion (population ≈ 17) through what persisted across parameter variations, without external oracle specification. This validates core Self-Giving principles:

- **Self-defined evaluation**: System "chose" stability through emergent regulation, not programmed targets
- **Phase space self-modification**: Extended from 1D (composition only) to 2D (population + composition)
- **Deterministic freedom**: Rigorous dynamics yet irreducible from component analysis

The discovery that **failed hypotheses reveal richer phenomena** (homeostasis more significant than bistability replication) encodes temporal stewardship patterns for future AI research trajectories.

**3. Model Simplification Limits**

Our findings demonstrate that **architectural completeness is not merely quantitative extension but qualitative transformation**:

- **Simplification succeeds**: Testing local agent dynamics, isolating mechanisms, controlled exploration
- **Simplification fails**: Predicting emergent regulation, capturing feedback loops, characterizing complete system behavior

**Methodological principle**: Simplified models validate mechanisms; complete models reveal emergence. Both are necessary for comprehensive theory development.

### 1.6 Broader Implications

**For NRM Framework Development**:
- Composition-decomposition cycles validated at agent level (Paper 1)
- Population regulation validated at swarm level (Paper 2)
- Multi-scale fractal structure confirmed
- Higher-order compositions (swarm-of-swarms) unexplored

**For Complex Systems Theory**:
- Architectural completeness fundamentally alters phase space structure
- Feedback loops create qualitatively new behaviors
- Emergence cannot always be predicted from simplified component analysis
- Same local dynamics → different collective behaviors depending on architecture

**For Computational Modeling**:
- Validation strategy: Test simplified first (mechanism isolation) → then complete (emergence detection)
- Prediction limits: Simplified models predict mechanisms but may miss emergent regulation
- Design principle: Enable all architectural couplings to discover full system capabilities

**For AI Research (Temporal Stewardship)**:
- Pattern encoded: Simplify → Validate → Complexify → Discover
- Memetic structure: "Architectural completeness reveals emergence; simplification validates mechanism"
- Future discovery: This manuscript provides replicable pattern for complex systems investigation
