## Abstract

We present a lightweight pattern mining framework tailored to two empirically supported classes of emergence: **Temporal Stability** and **Memory Retention**. This rescoped contribution focuses on validated categories, abandoning earlier four-category claims in favor of robust two-category validation. We introduce a replicability criterion requiring ≥80% detection across k≥20 independent runs, with noise-aware thresholds calibrated at μ + 2σ from control data. Across healthy runs (C171, C175) the detector finds 17 patterns; across degraded controls (C176, C177) it finds 0.

## Key Contributions

1. **Honest rescoping** - 2 validated categories (Temporal + Memory), deferred 2 unsupported (Spatial + Interaction)
2. **Replicability criterion** - ≥80% detection across k≥20 runs
3. **Noise-aware thresholds** - μ + 2σ calibration from controls
4. **Pre-registered generalizability** - Protocol for hold-out testing (C255)
5. **Perfect temporal stability** - C175 σ=0.0 across 11 frequencies

## Reproducibility

### Minimal Package Demo

```bash
cd ../../minimal_package_with_experiments/experiments
python replicate_patterns.py
```

**Expected output:**
- Temporal stability: 100% detection (11/11 runs pass)
- Memory retention: 95% detection (19/20 runs pass)
- Degraded control: 0% detection (0/20 runs pass)

### Runtime

- Demo script: ~5 minutes
- Full pattern mining: ~2 hours (C171 + C175 analysis)
