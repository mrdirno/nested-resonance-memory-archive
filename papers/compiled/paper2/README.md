## Abstract

We characterize three distinct dynamical regimes across progressive framework implementations to determine what mechanisms enable sustained populations in fractal agent systems. Through systematic ablation across (1) Single-agent with composition detection (C168-170), (2) Multi-agent with birth but no death (C171), and (3) Complete birth-death coupling with energy recharge parameter sweep (C176), we identify: **Regime 1 (Bistability)** - sharp transition at f_crit ≈ 2.55% with bistable attractors; **Regime 2 (Accumulation)** - apparent stabilization revealed as architectural incompleteness; **Regime 3 (Collapse)** - catastrophic collapse regardless of 100× recharge rate variation. Statistical analysis confirms zero effect of energy recharge (F(2,27)=0.00, p=1.000, η²=0.000), revealing death-birth imbalance as fundamental constraint. Hypothesis testing (C177 H1) **rejected energy pooling** as primary mechanism (Cohen's d=0.0, p=1.0), redirecting focus to alternative sustainability mechanisms.

## Key Contributions

1. **Three-regime classification** - Bistability, Accumulation, Collapse as fundamental dynamical categories
2. **Birth-death coupling necessary but insufficient** - Energy recharge fails across 100× parameter range
3. **H1 hypothesis rejection** - Temporal asymmetries dominate over resource distribution
4. **Death-birth imbalance quantified** - Death rate (~0.013/cycle) >> sustained birth rate (~0.005/cycle)

## Key Findings

- **Regime 1:** Single-agent bistability with sharp phase transition at f_crit ≈ 2.55%
- **Regime 2:** Multi-agent accumulation exposed as missing death mechanism (architectural gap)
- **Regime 3:** Complete framework exhibits perfect deterministic collapse across all conditions
- **Zero recharge effect:** Statistical tests confirm energy recharge insufficient (η²=0.000)
- **H1 falsification:** Energy pooling hypothesis rejected (Cohen's d=0.0, p=1.0)

## Reproducibility

### Experiments

- **C168-170:** Single-agent composition detection (Regime 1)
- **C171:** Multi-agent birth-only (Regime 2)
- **C176 V2/V3/V4:** Complete birth-death with recharge sweep (Regime 3)
- **C177 H1:** Energy pooling hypothesis test (rejected)

### Runtime

- Each condition: n=10 seeds, f=2.5%, 3,000 cycles
- Total runtime: ~150 experiments, 450,000+ validated cycles
