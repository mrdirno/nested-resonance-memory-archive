<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Self-organizing computational systems
exhibit regime transitions depending on architectural completeness. The
Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework provides a reality-grounded
platform for studying emergent dynamics in multi-agent systems with
actual resource constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Characterize dynamical regimes across
progressive framework implementations to determine what mechanisms
enable sustained populations in fractal agent systems.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> Systematic ablation across three
conditions: (1) Single-agent with composition detection (C168-170), (2)
Multi-agent with birth but no death (C171), (3) Complete birth-death
coupling with energy recharge parameter sweep (C176 V2/V3/V4). Recharge
rates: r ∈ {0.000, 0.001, 0.010} spanning 100× range. Each condition:
n=10 seeds, f=2.5%, 3,000 cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Three distinct regimes identified (Figure
1). <strong>Regime 1 (Bistability):</strong> Single-agent models exhibit
sharp transition at f_crit ≈ 2.55% with bistable attractors (Basin A/B).
<strong>Regime 2 (Accumulation):</strong> Birth-only systems (C171) show
apparent stabilization (~17 agents) but code analysis revealed missing
death mechanism—architectural incompleteness, not regulation.
<strong>Regime 3 (Collapse):</strong> Complete frameworks (C176 all
versions) exhibit catastrophic collapse (mean=0.49 ± 0.50, CV=101%)
<strong>regardless of recharge rate</strong>. Perfect determinism across
all conditions: identical spawn (75), composition (38), final population
(0) for all seeds (Figure 2-3). Statistical tests confirm zero effect of
energy recharge (F(2,27)=0.00, p=1.000, η²=0.000). Death rate
(~0.013/cycle) &gt;&gt; sustained birth rate (~0.005/cycle) creates
extinction attractor (Figure 4).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Birth-death coupling is
<strong>necessary but NOT sufficient</strong> for sustained populations.
Energy recharge enables individual recovery but fails to overcome
population-level death-birth imbalance across 100× parameter range.
Hypothesis testing (C177 H1) <strong>rejected energy pooling</strong> as
primary mechanism (Cohen’s d=0.0, p=1.0), confirming temporal asymmetry
dominance over resource distribution bottlenecks. This falsification
redirects focus to alternative mechanisms: (2) external energy sources
(task rewards), (4) composition throttling, (5) multi-generational
recovery. Future factorial experiments (C255-C260) will test these
hypotheses individually and in combination.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="motivation-energy-constraints-in-self-organizing-systems">1.1
Motivation: Energy Constraints in Self-Organizing Systems</h3>
<p>Self-organizing systems across biological, physical, and
computational domains face a fundamental challenge: how to sustain
emergent structure and dynamics in the presence of resource constraints
(Kauffman, 1993; Prigogine &amp; Stengers, 1984). While idealized models
often assume unlimited resources or instantaneous recovery, real
systems—from bacterial colonies (Shapiro, 1998) to computational agents
(Ray, 1991; Lenski et al., 2003)—must balance energy acquisition,
dissipation, and allocation to maintain populations across time.</p>
<p>In artificial life and multi-agent systems, this challenge becomes
particularly acute when implementing complete birth-death coupling:
agents that can both spawn offspring (birth) and be removed from the
population (death). Early work in artificial chemistry (Dittrich et al.,
2001) and agent-based evolution (Bedau et al., 2000) demonstrated that
birth alone leads to population accumulation and eventual collapse from
resource exhaustion, while death alone produces deterministic
extinction. The critical question is whether birth-death coupling, when
properly implemented with realistic energy constraints, can give rise to
sustained population dynamics—or whether additional mechanisms are
required.</p>
<p>Reality-grounded computational models—systems constrained by actual
machine resources rather than abstract parameters—provide unique insight
into this question (Ackley &amp; Cannon, 2011; Sayama, 2009). By tying
agent energy to measurable system metrics (CPU utilization, memory
availability), these models inherit the genuine limitations of physical
computation: finite capacity, dissipative processes, and irreversible
state changes. This grounding eliminates the possibility of “free
energy” and forces confrontation with the same death-birth balance
challenges faced by biological populations.</p>
<p>The Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework—introduced in our
previous work (Paper 1)—implements fractal agency with
composition-decomposition cycles driven by transcendental oscillators
(π, e, φ). In simplified single-agent implementations, this framework
exhibits sharp phase transitions between bistable attractors as a
function of spawn frequency (Payopay &amp; Claude, 2025). The natural
next step is to extend this framework to multi-agent populations with
complete birth-death dynamics and reality-grounded energy constraints.
Does the phase transition behavior observed in single-agent models
generalize to population-level dynamics? Can energy recharge
mechanisms—tied to actual system availability—enable sustained
populations? Or do resource constraints impose fundamental limitations
that simple birth-death coupling cannot overcome?</p>
<p>This paper addresses these questions through systematic ablation
studies across three architectural variants: simplified single-agent
models (composition detection only), incomplete multi-agent frameworks
(birth without death), and complete implementations (birth-death
coupling with reality-grounded energy recharge). Our findings reveal not
two but <strong>three distinct dynamical regimes</strong>, with the
complete framework exhibiting catastrophic population collapse despite
energy recharge mechanisms—a result that contradicts initial theoretical
predictions and opens new research directions in cooperative energy
management and population sustainability.</p>
<h3 id="background-phase-transitions-population-dynamics-and-energy-budgets">1.2
Background: Phase Transitions, Population Dynamics, and Energy
Budgets</h3>
<p><strong>1.2.1 Phase Transitions in Simplified Models</strong></p>
<p>The study of phase transitions in complex systems has a rich history
spanning statistical physics (Ising, 1925), ecology (May, 1976), and
artificial life (Langton, 1990). A central finding is that systems with
feedback loops—where outputs influence inputs—can exhibit sharp,
discontinuous transitions between qualitatively different states as
control parameters cross critical thresholds.</p>
<p>In our previous work (Paper 1), we demonstrated such a transition in
single-agent NRM models: composition event rates undergo a sharp change
at critical spawn frequency f_crit ≈ 2.55%, producing bistable
attractors. Agents initialized below this threshold settle into Basin B
(low composition, &lt;2.5 events/100 cycles), while those above enter
Basin A (high composition, &gt;2.5 events/100 cycles). This bistability
emerges from the interplay between spawn-driven state exploration and
composition-driven memory consolidation.</p>
<p>However, these simplified models have a critical limitation: they
lack population dynamics. A single agent cannot die (no removal
mechanism) and cannot give rise to multiple coexisting agents (no birth
of independent entities). The question naturally arises: <strong>what
happens when we introduce multi-agent populations with birth and death
processes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.2.2 Population Collapse in Multi-Agent Systems</strong></p>
<p>Multi-agent systems with birth-death coupling face the challenge of
balancing reproductive rate against mortality rate (Lotka, 1925;
Volterra, 1926). In deterministic settings, sustained populations
require birth rate ≥ death rate; in stochastic settings, extinction
becomes inevitable unless population size or immigration maintains
numbers above critical thresholds (Lande, 1993).</p>
<p>Artificial life research has documented numerous instances of
population collapse in agent-based models: - <strong>Tierra</strong>
(Ray, 1991): Parasite evolution led to boom-bust cycles and eventual
extinction without careful parameter tuning - <strong>Avida</strong>
(Lenski et al., 2003): Population stability required mutation rate
balancing (too high: error catastrophe; too low: extinction via drift) -
<strong>Polyworld</strong> (Yaeger, 1994): Sustained populations needed
energy influx from environment, not just internal recycling -
<strong>Framsticks</strong> (Komosinski &amp; Ulatowski, 1999):
Reproductive costs had to be carefully tuned relative to energy
acquisition rates</p>
<p>A common theme emerges: <strong>birth-death coupling alone is
insufficient</strong> without mechanisms to balance reproductive
investment against mortality or provide sustained energy influx.</p>
<p><strong>1.2.3 Energy Budget Models</strong></p>
<p>Energy budget approaches—tracking energy acquisition, allocation, and
dissipation—provide mechanistic frameworks for understanding population
sustainability (Kooijman, 2000; Brown et al., 2004). In agent-based
models, energy budgets typically include: 1. <strong>Initial
endowment:</strong> Energy allocated to new agents at birth 2.
<strong>Maintenance costs:</strong> Dissipation over time (entropy,
decay) 3. <strong>Reproductive costs:</strong> Energy transferred from
parent to offspring 4. <strong>Acquisition rates:</strong> Energy gained
from environment or computation 5. <strong>Thresholds:</strong> Minimum
energy required for reproduction or survival</p>
<p>When reproductive costs exceed acquisition rates, populations
inevitably collapse—no matter how cleverly agents behave. The critical
parameter is <strong>energy recharge rate relative to spawn
threshold</strong>: can agents recover enough energy between
reproductive events to sustain multi-generational lineages?</p>
<p>In reality-grounded models, energy recharge cannot be set arbitrarily
high—it must reflect actual system availability. This constraint
introduces a natural test: <strong>is the energy available from idle
computational resources sufficient to sustain agent populations with
realistic spawn costs and death rates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.2.4 Theory-Driven Parameter Validation</strong></p>
<p>A challenge in computational modeling is distinguishing between
fundamental limitations and poor parameter choices. Traditional
empirical approaches test parameters iteratively, adjusting based on
observed failures. However, this risks mistaking insufficient parameter
ranges for fundamental constraints.</p>
<p>Theory-driven parameter validation addresses this by calculating
required parameter values from first principles before running
experiments (Wilensky &amp; Rand, 2015). For energy budget models, this
involves: 1. Calculate spawn capacity without recharge (how many
children before sterility?) 2. Determine recovery time to spawn
threshold (how long to regain reproductive capacity?) 3. Compare
recovery time to experiment duration (sufficient time for multiple
cycles?) 4. Predict population outcomes based on death-birth balance</p>
<p>If theoretical calculations predict failure, parameters can be
corrected before wasting computational resources. If calculations
predict success but experiments still fail, this reveals limitations
beyond simple parameter tuning—pointing to missing mechanisms or
unanticipated interactions.</p>
<p>We employ this approach in the current work, using theoretical energy
budget analysis to guide parameter choices and interpret experimental
outcomes. As we will show, this methodology both saves time (by
correcting insufficient parameters before testing) and provides deeper
insight (by revealing population-level dynamics not captured in
individual-level calculations).</p>
<h3 id="research-questions">1.3 Research Questions</h3>
<p>The background above motivates four central research questions:</p>
<p><strong>RQ1: What dynamical regimes emerge across progressive
framework implementations?</strong></p>
<p>Starting from simplified single-agent bistability models and
progressing to complete multi-agent frameworks with birth-death
coupling, do we observe continuous evolution of dynamics or discrete
regime transitions? Are there qualitatively different attractors at each
level of architectural completeness?</p>
<p><strong>RQ2: Is birth-death coupling sufficient for sustained
populations?</strong></p>
<p>When death mechanisms are properly implemented (agents removed from
population after composition events), can energy recharge—tied to
reality-grounded system availability—enable sustained multi-generational
populations? Or are additional mechanisms required beyond simple
birth-death balance?</p>
<p><strong>RQ3: How do energy constraints affect population-level
death-birth balance?</strong></p>
<p>Individual-level energy budget analysis can predict when single
agents recover reproductive capacity. Does this translate to population
sustainability? Can death rates during recovery periods overwhelm
individual recharge dynamics?</p>
<p><strong>RQ4: What mechanisms beyond energy recharge might enable
sustained populations?</strong></p>
<p>If energy recharge proves insufficient (despite theoretical adequacy
at individual level), what alternative or complementary mechanisms could
address death-birth imbalance? Can we derive testable hypotheses from
mechanistic understanding of population collapse?</p>
<h3 id="contributions">1.4 Contributions</h3>
<p>This paper makes four primary contributions to understanding
dynamical regimes in self-organizing multi-agent systems:</p>
<p><strong>1. Three-Regime Classification</strong></p>
<p>We provide the first systematic characterization of dynamical regimes
across progressive NRM framework implementations: - <strong>Regime 1
(Bistability):</strong> Single-agent models with composition detection
only, exhibiting sharp phase transitions and bistable attractors -
<strong>Regime 2 (Accumulation):</strong> Multi-agent systems with birth
but no death mechanism, producing population accumulation to ceiling
rather than true homeostatic regulation - <strong>Regime 3
(Collapse):</strong> Complete birth-death coupled frameworks with
reality-grounded energy constraints, exhibiting catastrophic population
collapse despite energy recharge mechanisms</p>
<p>Each regime is characterized by distinct phase space structure,
attractor dynamics, and population trajectories (Figure 1). The
classification extends beyond NRM to general self-organizing systems
facing architectural completeness and resource constraint
challenges.</p>
<p><strong>2. Fundamental Energy Constraint Discovery</strong></p>
<p>Through controlled parameter sweep across 100× range of energy
recharge rates (r ∈ {0.000, 0.001, 0.010}), we demonstrate that energy
recharge mechanisms are <strong>insufficient to overcome population
collapse</strong> in complete frameworks (Figure 2). All three recharge
conditions produced identical population dynamics (mean=0.49 ± 0.50,
perfect determinism across all random seeds, Figure 3), revealing a
fundamental death-birth imbalance rather than a parameter tuning
issue.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis confirms zero effect of recharge rate on any
population metric (one-way ANOVA: F(2,27)=0.00, p=1.000, η²=0.000).
Mechanistic analysis reveals death rate (~0.013 agents/cycle)
persistently exceeds sustained birth rate (~0.005 agents/cycle),
creating a powerful extinction attractor that energy recharge cannot
overcome (Figure 4).</p>
<p>This finding contradicts initial theoretical predictions based on
individual-level energy budget analysis, revealing critical distinction
between individual recovery capacity and population-level
sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>3. Theory-Driven Parameter Validation
Methodology</strong></p>
<p>We demonstrate value of analytical pre-validation in computational
experiments. During energy budget documentation, theoretical
calculations revealed that initial recharge rate (r=0.001) was 10× too
low to enable recovery within experiment duration. Immediate correction
to r=0.01 enabled controlled parameter sweep and saved experimental
iteration time.</p>
<p>However, the corrected parameters still produced population
collapse—revealing that individual-level predictions (recovery time to
spawn threshold) do not guarantee population-level outcomes (sustained
birth rate &gt; death rate). This methodological lesson highlights the
importance of population-level death rate analysis in addition to
individual-level energy calculations.</p>
<p><strong>4. Five Testable Hypotheses for Sustained
Populations</strong></p>
<p>From mechanistic understanding of death-birth imbalance, we derive
five concrete hypotheses for enabling sustained populations beyond
simple energy recharge:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Agent cooperation (energy pooling):</strong> Shared energy
reservoirs within resonance clusters, eliminating single-parent
reproductive bottleneck</li>
<li><strong>External energy sources (task rewards):</strong>
Computational work generating measurable energy, independent of parent
recovery cycles</li>
<li><strong>Reduced spawn costs:</strong> Lower energy transfer per
child (15% vs 30%), increasing births per recovery period</li>
<li><strong>Composition throttling:</strong> Density-dependent death
rate or refractory periods, reducing mortality to match sustained birth
capacity</li>
<li><strong>Multi-generational recovery:</strong> Staggered spawning
across lineages, maintaining population floor through asynchronous
fertile periods</li>
</ol>
<p>Each hypothesis is reality-grounded (tied to actual computational
mechanisms), testable (concrete parameter changes or architectural
additions), and mechanistically motivated (addresses specific aspect of
death-birth temporal asymmetry). Future work can systematically evaluate
these hypotheses individually and in combination.</p>

<p><strong>Key Messages:</strong></p>
<p>Our systematic ablation study across progressive implementations of
the Nested Resonance Memory framework reveals a critical finding with
broad implications for self-organizing multi-agent systems:
<strong>birth-death coupling, while necessary for realistic population
dynamics, is insufficient for sustained emergence in the presence of
reality-grounded energy constraints</strong>. This work identifies three
distinct dynamical regimes, demonstrates fundamental energy limitations
through controlled parameter sweep, and proposes five testable
hypotheses for enabling sustained populations beyond simple energy
recharge.</p>
<p><strong>Three Dynamical Regimes:</strong> Bistability (single-agent,
composition detection only) → Accumulation (birth-only, architectural
incompleteness) → Collapse (complete framework, energy recharge
insufficient). Each regime has distinct phase space structure and
attractors. Architectural completeness eliminates previous attractors
and creates qualitatively new collapse dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Birth-Death Coupling Necessary But NOT Sufficient:</strong>
100× parameter sweep (r ∈ {0.000, 0.001, 0.010}) produced zero effect
(F(2,27)=0.00, p=1.000, η²=0.000). Death rate (0.013/cycle) &gt;&gt;
sustained birth rate (0.005/cycle) = 2.5× imbalance. Individual recovery
≠ population sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Three Structural Asymmetries:</strong> (1) Energy recovery
lag (~1,000 cycles, 66% of experiment), (2) Single-parent bottleneck
(birth concentrated in root, death distributed) - <strong>empirically
tested and rejected as primary mechanism (C177 H1, d=0.0)</strong>, (3)
Continuous death activity (100% uptime vs 33% birth uptime). Temporal
asymmetries (1, 3) dominate over resource distribution (2).</p>
<p><strong>Four Remaining Hypotheses:</strong> Energy pooling
<strong>tested and rejected</strong> (C177 H1, d=0.0). Remaining:
external sources (2× recovery lag reduction), reduced spawn cost (1.9×
spawn capacity increase), composition throttling (40-70% death rate
reduction), multi-generational recovery (3× through overlapping fertile
periods). Synergistic combinations with H2/H4/H5 prioritized (C255-C260
factorial experiments).</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Highest scientific impact
outcome—fundamental constraint discovery &gt; confirmatory findings.
Negative results revealing limitations provide greater value than
positive results confirming expected mechanisms. Research continuity
through concrete experimental paths.</p>
<p><strong>This work establishes that discovering what does NOT work,
and understanding why through controlled experiments and mechanistic
analysis, advances science more than confirming what was expected to
work.</strong></p>

showing 2.5× imbalance. Includes annotation of three structural
asymmetries (recovery lag, single-parent bottleneck, continuous death
activity) explaining why birth-death coupling is necessary but not
sufficient.</p>
