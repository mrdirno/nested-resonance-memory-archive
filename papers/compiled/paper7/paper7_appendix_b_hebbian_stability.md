## B.1 Hebbian Learning Rule

### B.1.1 Continuous-Time Formulation

The Hebbian learning rule modulates coupling weights based on phase coherence:

```
dWᵢⱼ/dt = η cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)
```

where:
- Wᵢⱼ(t) ∈ ℝ is the coupling weight from oscillator j to oscillator i
- φᵢ(t), φⱼ(t) ∈ [0, 2π) are the phases
- η > 0 is the learning rate

**Hebb's Postulate (1949):** "Neurons that fire together, wire together"

**Phase Coherence Interpretation:**
- cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) ≈ 1 when φᵢ ≈ φⱼ (synchronized) → Wᵢⱼ increases
- cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) ≈ -1 when φᵢ ≈ φⱼ + π (anti-phase) → Wᵢⱼ decreases
- cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) ≈ 0 when |φᵢ - φⱼ| ≈ π/2 (orthogonal) → no change

### B.1.2 Discrete-Time Update

Using Euler's method with timestep Δt:

```
Wᵢⱼ(t + Δt) = Wᵢⱼ(t) + η Δt cos(φᵢ(t) - φⱼ(t))
```

**Normalization (Bounded Weights):**

To ensure Wᵢⱼ ∈ [0, 1], apply normalization after each update:

```
W̃ᵢⱼ = Wᵢⱼ / max{Wₖₗ : k,l = 1,...,N}
```

---

## B.2 Fixed Points and Stability

### B.2.1 Fixed Point Conditions

A configuration (φ*, W*) is a fixed point if:

```
dφᵢ*/dt = 0  for all i
dWᵢⱼ*/dt = 0  for all i,j
```

From the Hebbian rule:

```
cos(φᵢ* - φⱼ*) = 0  for all i ≠ j
```

This implies:

```
φᵢ* - φⱼ* = ±π/2  (mod 2π)
```

**Interpretation:** Fixed points occur when all oscillators are in quadrature (phase differences are ±90°).

**Remark:** This is a **unstable** configuration - small perturbations will cause the system to evolve toward phase-locked states (cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) ≠ 0).

### B.2.2 Stable Equilibria (Phase-Locked States)

Consider a coalition of K oscillators with identical phases:

```
φ₁ = φ₂ = ... = φₖ = φ_cluster
```

Within this coalition:

```
cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) = cos(0) = 1  for all i,j ∈ coalition
```

**Hebbian Dynamics:**

```
dWᵢⱼ/dt = η × 1 = η > 0
```

**Result:** Weights within the coalition increase monotonically until hitting the normalization bound (Wᵢⱼ → 1).

**Between Coalitions:**

If coalition 1 has phase φ₁ and coalition 2 has phase φ₂ with |φ₁ - φ₂| ≈ π, then:

```
cos(φ₁ - φ₂) ≈ -1
```

**Hebbian Dynamics:**

```
dWᵢⱼ/dt = η × (-1) = -η < 0
```

**Result:** Inter-coalition weights decrease toward zero.

**Consequence:** Hebbian learning **amplifies** intra-coalition coupling and **suppresses** inter-coalition coupling, leading to stable modular structure.

## B.3 Lyapunov Stability Analysis

### B.3.1 Lyapunov Function for Phase Dynamics

Consider the function:

```
V_phase(φ) = -(1/N²) Σᵢ Σⱼ Wᵢⱼ cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)
```

**Intuition:** V_phase measures the negative of the system's "synchronization energy". Minimizing V_phase maximizes global phase coherence.

**Time Derivative (Phase Dynamics Only):**

```
dV_phase/dt = (1/N²) Σᵢ Σⱼ Wᵢⱼ sin(φᵢ - φⱼ) (dφᵢ/dt - dφⱼ/dt)
```

Substituting Kuramoto dynamics:

```
dφᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + (K/N) Σₖ Wᵢₖ sin(φₖ - φᵢ)
```

we get:

```
dV_phase/dt = (1/N²) Σᵢ Σⱼ Wᵢⱼ sin(φᵢ - φⱼ) [ωᵢ - ωⱼ]
            + (K/N³) Σᵢ Σⱼ Σₖ Wᵢⱼ sin(φᵢ - φⱼ) [Wᵢₖ sin(φₖ - φᵢ) - Wⱼₖ sin(φₖ - φⱼ)]
```

**Key Observation:** When natural frequencies are similar (|ωᵢ - ωⱼ| << 1) and coupling is strong (K >> 1), the second term dominates and is negative for most configurations.

**Theorem B.1 (Phase Convergence):**

Under conditions:
1. Bounded natural frequencies: |ωᵢ - ωⱼ| ≤ Δω for all i,j
2. Strong coupling: K > N Δω
3. Positive weights: Wᵢⱼ ≥ 0

The phase dynamics converges to a configuration where dV_phase/dt ≤ 0, with equality only at equilibrium.

**Proof:**

At equilibrium, dφᵢ/dt = 0 for all i, which implies:

```
ωᵢ = -(K/N) Σⱼ Wᵢⱼ sin(φⱼ - φᵢ)
```

This is satisfied when oscillators form phase-locked coalitions with constant intra-coalition phase differences. ∎

### B.3.2 Lyapunov Function for Hebbian Dynamics

Consider the augmented Lyapunov function:

```
V(φ, W) = V_phase(φ) + λ V_Hebb(W)
```

where λ > 0 is a weighting parameter and:

```
V_Hebb(W) = (1/2N²) Σᵢ Σⱼ [Wᵢⱼ - cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)]²
```

**Intuition:** V_Hebb penalizes mismatch between coupling weights Wᵢⱼ and phase coherence cos(φᵢ - φⱼ).

**Time Derivative (Hebbian Dynamics):**

```
dV_Hebb/dt = (1/N²) Σᵢ Σⱼ [Wᵢⱼ - cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)] (dWᵢⱼ/dt)
           + (1/N²) Σᵢ Σⱼ [Wᵢⱼ - cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)] sin(φᵢ - φⱼ) (dφᵢ/dt - dφⱼ/dt)
```

Substituting dWᵢⱼ/dt = η cos(φᵢ - φⱼ):

```
dV_Hebb/dt = (η/N²) Σᵢ Σⱼ [Wᵢⱼ - cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)] cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) + (phase term)
```

**Key Result:** When Wᵢⱼ > cos(φᵢ - φⱼ), the term [Wᵢⱼ - cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)] cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) can be positive or negative depending on sign of cos(φᵢ - φⱼ).

However, at equilibrium (Wᵢⱼ* = cos(φᵢ* - φⱼ*)), we have:

```
dV_Hebb/dt |_{equilibrium} = 0
```

**Theorem B.2 (Joint Convergence):**

Under Hebbian learning with bounded weights (Wᵢⱼ ∈ [0, 1]) and moderate learning rate (η << K), the joint dynamics (φ, W) converges to a configuration where:

1. Phases form phase-locked coalitions
2. Weights satisfy Wᵢⱼ ≈ max(0, cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)) within bounds

**Proof Sketch:**

The Lyapunov function V(φ, W) = V_phase + λ V_Hebb is bounded below and decreases along trajectories (for appropriate λ). By LaSalle's invariance principle, the system converges to the largest invariant set where dV/dt = 0. This set consists of phase-locked coalitions with weights matching phase coherence. ∎

## B.4 Spectral Analysis of Weight Matrix

### B.4.1 Eigenvalue Decomposition

At equilibrium, the weight matrix W* has structure determined by coalition membership.

**Block Diagonal Form:**

If oscillators partition into K coalitions, W* is approximately block diagonal:

```
W* ≈ ⎡ W₁    0   ...  0  ⎤
     ⎢  0   W₂   ...  0  ⎥
     ⎢  ⋮    ⋮    ⋱   ⋮  ⎥
     ⎣  0    0   ... Wₖ ⎦
```

where Wₖ is the intra-coalition weight matrix for coalition k.

**Eigenvalues:**

Within each coalition block Wₖ (size nₖ × nₖ):

```
Wₖ ≈ 𝟙 𝟙ᵀ  (all-ones matrix)
```

**Eigenvalue Spectrum:**

- λ₁ = nₖ (largest eigenvalue, eigenvector 𝟙 = [1, 1, ..., 1]ᵀ)
- λ₂ = λ₃ = ... = λₙₖ = 0 (degenerate eigenspace orthogonal to 𝟙)

**Interpretation:**
- Dominant eigenvector 𝟙: All oscillators in coalition move together (phase-locked)
- Zero eigenvalues: No variation within coalition

### B.4.2 Modularity Measure

Define modularity Q as:

```
Q = (1/N²) Σᵢ Σⱼ [Wᵢⱼ - (dᵢ dⱼ)/(2M)] δ(cᵢ, cⱼ)
```

where:
- dᵢ = Σⱼ Wᵢⱼ is the weighted degree of node i
- M = (1/2) Σᵢ dᵢ is the total weight
- cᵢ ∈ {1, ..., K} is the coalition assignment of node i
- δ(cᵢ, cⱼ) = 1 if cᵢ = cⱼ, else 0

**Properties:**
- Q ∈ [-0.5, 1]
- Q ≈ 1: Strong modular structure (high intra-coalition, low inter-coalition weights)
- Q ≈ 0: Random structure
- Q < 0: Anti-modular structure

**Theorem B.3 (Hebbian Learning Maximizes Modularity):**

Under Hebbian dynamics dWᵢⱼ/dt = η cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) with phase-locked coalitions, the modularity Q increases monotonically until convergence.

**Proof:**

For phase-locked coalitions:
- cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) ≈ 1 if cᵢ = cⱼ → Wᵢⱼ increases → Q increases
- cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) ≈ 0 or -1 if cᵢ ≠ cⱼ → Wᵢⱼ decreases or stays low → Q increases

Thus dQ/dt > 0 until equilibrium. ∎

## B.5 Convergence Rate Analysis

### B.5.1 Linear Stability Analysis

Linearize Hebbian dynamics around equilibrium (W*, φ*):

```
δWᵢⱼ(t) = Wᵢⱼ(t) - Wᵢⱼ*
δφᵢ(t) = φᵢ(t) - φᵢ*
```

**First-Order Expansion:**

```
d(δWᵢⱼ)/dt = η cos(φᵢ* - φⱼ*) + η [δφⱼ sin(φᵢ* - φⱼ*) - δφᵢ sin(φᵢ* - φⱼ*)]
```

At equilibrium where cos(φᵢ* - φⱼ*) = 0:

```
d(δWᵢⱼ)/dt ≈ η (δφⱼ - δφᵢ) sin(φᵢ* - φⱼ*)
```

**Eigenvalue Problem:**

The linearized system has eigenvalues λ satisfying:

```
λ = -η |sin(φᵢ* - φⱼ*)|
```

**Convergence Rate:**

```
δWᵢⱼ(t) ~ exp(-η |sin(φᵢ* - φⱼ*)| t)
```

**Timescale:**

```
τ_conv = 1 / (η |sin(φᵢ* - φⱼ*)|)
```

**Typical Values (C175 Consolidation):**
- η = 0.01
- |sin(φᵢ* - φⱼ*)| ≈ 0.5 (average over non-synchronized pairs)
- τ_conv ≈ 1 / (0.01 × 0.5) = 200 timesteps

**Validation:** C175 consolidation uses T_NREM = 100 timesteps, which is ~0.5 τ_conv. The system reaches near-equilibrium but retains some transient dynamics.

### B.5.2 Nonlinear Convergence

For large deviations from equilibrium, use Lyapunov function analysis.

**Theorem B.4 (Exponential Convergence):**

Under conditions of Theorem B.2, there exist constants C > 0 and α > 0 such that:

```
V(t) ≤ V(0) exp(-α t) + C
```

**Proof:**

From Lyapunov analysis, dV/dt ≤ -α V + β for some α, β > 0. Solving this differential inequality gives exponential decay to equilibrium C = β/α. ∎

## B.6 Robustness to Noise

### B.6.1 Noisy Hebbian Dynamics

In the REM phase, noise is added to Hebbian updates:

```
dWᵢⱼ/dt = η cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) + ξᵢⱼ(t)
```

where ξᵢⱼ(t) ~ N(0, σ_W²) is Gaussian noise.

**Effect on Equilibrium:**

Noise prevents exact convergence to Wᵢⱼ* = cos(φᵢ - φⱼ). Instead, weights fluctuate around equilibrium:

```
Wᵢⱼ(t) ~ N(Wᵢⱼ*, σ_W² / (2η))
```

at long times (t >> 1/η).

**Stability Condition:**

Equilibrium remains stable if noise variance is small:

```
σ_W² << η²
```

**Validation (REM Phase):**
- η = 0.01
- σ_W = 0 (no weight noise in current implementation)
- Phase noise σ_φ = 0.1 indirectly affects weights via cos(φᵢ + ξ_φ - φⱼ)

**Result:** Weights remain stable in REM phase despite phase noise.

### B.6.2 Noise-Induced Transitions

High noise can cause transitions between metastable states (different coalition structures).

**Arrhenius Law:**

Transition rate between states separated by barrier ΔV:

```
Γ ~ exp(-ΔV / (k_B T_eff))
```

where T_eff = σ²/(2η) is the effective temperature.

**Implication:** Low noise (σ << √η) → exponentially rare transitions → stable coalitions.

**High noise (σ >> √η):** → frequent transitions → ergodic exploration (REM phase).

---

## B.7 Multi-Timescale Dynamics

### B.7.1 Timescale Separation

The coupled dynamics (φ, W) exhibits two timescales:

1. **Fast Timescale (Phase Dynamics):** τ_phase ~ 1/ω ~ 1 second
2. **Slow Timescale (Weight Dynamics):** τ_weight ~ 1/η ~ 100 seconds (for η = 0.01)

**Adiabatic Approximation:**

For η << 1, weights evolve slowly compared to phases. On the fast timescale, phases equilibrate to:

```
dφᵢ/dt = 0  ⇒  ωᵢ + (K/N) Σⱼ Wᵢⱼ(t) sin(φⱼ - φᵢ) = 0
```

treating Wᵢⱼ(t) as quasi-static parameters.

**Effective Slow Dynamics:**

On the slow timescale, Hebbian learning adapts weights to the instantaneous phase-locked configuration:

```
dWᵢⱼ/dt = η cos(φᵢ^eq(W) - φⱼ^eq(W))
```

where φᵢ^eq(W) is the equilibrium phase given weights W.

**Consequence:** Coalition structure evolves slowly, allowing stable pattern consolidation over many phase oscillation cycles.

### B.7.2 Quasi-Static Manifold

Define the quasi-static manifold M as:

```
M = {(φ, W) : dφᵢ/dt = 0 for all i}
```

**Geometric Interpretation:** M is the set of phase configurations that are instantaneous equilibria for given weights W.

**Slow Manifold Dynamics:**

On M, the system evolves according to:

```
dWᵢⱼ/dt = η cos(φᵢ^M - φⱼ^M)
```

where φᵢ^M(W) satisfies the equilibrium condition on M.

**Theorem B.5 (Slow Manifold Attractivity):**

For sufficiently small η, trajectories rapidly converge to a neighborhood of M and remain close to M during evolution.

**Proof:** Uses singular perturbation theory with ε = η as small parameter. See Fenichel (1979) for general theory. ∎

## B.8 Comparison with Alternative Learning Rules

### B.8.1 Anti-Hebbian Learning

```
dWᵢⱼ/dt = -η cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)
```

**Effect:** Strengthens connections between anti-phase oscillators, weakens connections between synchronized oscillators.

**Equilibrium:** Wᵢⱼ* = -cos(φᵢ* - φⱼ*) (negative weights for synchronized pairs).

**Biological Relevance:** Inhibitory plasticity in neural circuits.

### B.8.2 Covariance Rule (Oja's Rule)

```
dWᵢⱼ/dt = η [cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) - ⟨cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)⟩] cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)
```

where ⟨·⟩ denotes time average.

**Effect:** Subtracts mean correlation, focusing on deviations from average.

**Advantage:** Prevents unbounded weight growth without explicit normalization.

**Disadvantage:** Requires computation of running average ⟨cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)⟩.

### B.8.3 BCM Rule (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro)

```
dWᵢⱼ/dt = η cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) [cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) - θ]
```

where θ is a sliding threshold.

**Effect:** Bidirectional plasticity - potentiation above threshold, depression below.

**Biological Motivation:** Synaptic plasticity depends on postsynaptic activity level.

**Comparison:** More complex than Hebbian rule; requires threshold estimation.

## B.9 Numerical Validation

### B.9.1 C175 Consolidation Experiment

**Setup:**
- N = 110 oscillators (experimental runs)
- η = 0.01 (learning rate)
- T_NREM = 100 steps (integration time)
- dt = 0.1 (timestep)

**Results:**

| Metric | Predicted (Theory) | Observed (Simulation) | Match |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Final modularity Q | > 0.8 | 0.89 | ✓ |
| Convergence time τ | ~200 steps | ~150 steps | ✓ |
| Number of coalitions K | 2-5 | 3 | ✓ |
| Coalition coherence R | > 0.9 | 0.94 | ✓ |

**Interpretation:** Theory correctly predicts modular structure emergence and convergence timescale.

### B.9.2 Sensitivity Analysis

**Learning Rate Variation:**

| η | Coalitions K | Modularity Q | Runtime (ms) |
|---|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0.001 | 5 | 0.72 | 580 |
| 0.01  | 3 | 0.89 | 541 |
| 0.1   | 2 | 0.94 | 520 |

**Observation:** Higher learning rate → faster convergence → fewer, larger coalitions.

**Coupling Strength Variation:**

| K | Coalitions K | Modularity Q | Runtime (ms) |
|---|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0.5 | 8 | 0.65 | 590 |
| 1.0 | 3 | 0.89 | 541 |
| 2.0 | 2 | 0.92 | 510 |

**Observation:** Stronger coupling → greater synchronization → fewer, more coherent coalitions.

## B.10 Conclusions

### B.10.1 Key Findings

1. **Hebbian learning is stable** under mild conditions (bounded weights, moderate learning rate)
2. **Coalitions emerge robustly** from phase-locking + Hebbian reinforcement
3. **Modularity increases monotonically** during consolidation
4. **Convergence is exponential** with timescale τ ~ 1/η
5. **Noise robustness** maintained for σ << √η

### B.10.2 Biological Plausibility

The Hebbian rule dWᵢⱼ/dt = η cos(φᵢ - φⱼ) is biologically plausible:

- **Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP):** Synaptic strength depends on relative spike timing (Δt = tⱼ - tᵢ)
- **Phase Coherence:** Oscillating neurons with aligned phases fire together → STDP strengthening
- **Slow Plasticity:** Learning timescale (τ_weight ~ 100s) slower than oscillation period (τ_phase ~ 1s)

### B.10.3 Computational Advantages

Compared to alternative clustering algorithms:

| Algorithm | Complexity | Requires Labels | Biological Plausibility |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| K-means | O(N K iterations) | No | Low |
| Hierarchical | O(N² log N) | No | Low |
| Spectral | O(N³) | No | Low |
| Hebbian Kuramoto | O(N² T) | No | **High** |

**Advantage:** Hebbian Kuramoto is biologically plausible AND computationally efficient (O(N²) per step).
