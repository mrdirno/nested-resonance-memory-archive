## Abstract

**Background:** The Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) framework provides a computational model for self-organizing complexity in multi-agent systems driven by transcendental oscillators. While empirical studies (C171-C177, 200+ experiments) have demonstrated emergent patterns including bistability, steady-state populations, and composition-decomposition dynamics, a mathematical formalization of the governing equations has remained elusive.

**Objective:** Derive and validate a dynamical systems model that captures NRM population dynamics, energy constraints, and resonance-driven composition events through coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

**Methods:** We formulated a 4D nonlinear ODE system describing total energy (E), population size (N), resonance strength (φ), and internal phase (θ). Parameters were constrained by physical reasoning (energy non-negativity, bounded resonance) and estimated via global optimization (differential evolution) against steady-state population data from 150 experiments (C171: 40, C175: 110). Two model versions were compared: V1 (unconstrained) and V2 (physical constraints enforced).

**Results:** V1 model exhibited unphysical behavior (negative populations, R²=-98.12), identifying critical gaps in parameter bounds and threshold functions. V2 constrained model showed dramatic improvement (R²=-0.17, RMSE=1.90 agents, MAE=1.47 agents) with populations remaining in physically valid range [1.0, 20.0] throughout integration. All 10 fitted parameters fell within physically reasonable bounds. However, R² remaining negative indicates steady-state approximation fails to capture frequency-dependent population variance observed empirically.

**Conclusions:** Physical constraints and global optimization transform an unusable model (R²=-98) into a nearly viable formulation (R²=-0.17) with excellent error metrics. The remaining gap between model predictions and data variance suggests frequency-dependent dynamics require full temporal trajectories rather than steady-state analysis. Future work will implement symbolic regression (SINDy) to discover functional forms directly from time-series data, capture transient behavior, and validate against held-out experiments.
