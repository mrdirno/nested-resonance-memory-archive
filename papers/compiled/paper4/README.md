## Abstract

We extend factorial validation of Nested Resonance Memory (NRM) mechanisms beyond pairwise interactions (Paper 3) to characterize three-way and four-way synergistic and antagonistic effects. Using complete factorial designs, we analyze 4 three-way combinations (H1×H2×H4, H1×H2×H5, H1×H4×H5, H2×H4×H5) and 1 four-way combination (H1×H2×H4×H5), encompassing 56 total experimental conditions (4×8 + 1×16).

Higher-order analysis reveals whether:
1. **Emergent synergies** arise when ≥3 mechanisms combine beyond pairwise predictions
2. **Pairwise models generalize** - Can pairwise interactions predict higher-order behavior?
3. **Complexity thresholds exist** - Do 3-way and 4-way effects differ qualitatively?

Results demonstrate [RESULTS PENDING - C262-C263 completion]. This characterization provides complete factorial mapping of mechanism interdependencies across all interaction orders, informing multi-mechanism optimization strategies for swarm intelligence systems.

## Experimental Design

### Factorial Structure

**Three-Way Interactions (4 combinations):**
1. **H1×H2×H4:** Energy Pooling × Reality Sources × Spawn Throttling
2. **H1×H2×H5:** Energy Pooling × Reality Sources × Energy Recovery
3. **H1×H4×H5:** Energy Pooling × Spawn Throttling × Energy Recovery
4. **H2×H4×H5:** Reality Sources × Spawn Throttling × Energy Recovery

Each 3-way: 2³ = 8 conditions (OFF-OFF-OFF, ON-OFF-OFF, OFF-ON-OFF, ..., ON-ON-ON)

**Four-Way Interaction (1 combination):**
5. **H1×H2×H4×H5:** All four mechanisms combined

4-way: 2⁴ = 16 conditions (OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF, ..., ON-ON-ON-ON)

**Total Experimental Conditions:**
- 3-way: 4 combinations × 8 conditions = 32 conditions
- 4-way: 1 combination × 16 conditions = 16 conditions
- **Grand Total: 56 conditions** (48 conditions via C262 + 8 conditions via C263)

### Mechanism Definitions

**H1 - Energy Pooling:**
Agents share energy within resonance clusters, distributing reproductive capacity across cluster members.

**H2 - Reality Sources:**
Multiple reality sampling sources provide diverse energy inputs, stabilizing population dynamics through resource diversification.

**H4 - Spawn Throttling:**
Cooldown period between spawns (e.g., 100 cycles minimum), preventing explosive growth.

**H5 - Energy Recovery:**
Boosts energy recovery rate through enhanced reality coupling, stabilizing populations by accelerating energy regeneration during low-energy states.

## Analysis Framework

### Higher-Order Synergy Calculation

**3-Way Interaction:**
```
Observed = ON-ON-ON (all three mechanisms active)

Predicted_from_pairwise = OFF-OFF-OFF +
                          (H1_effect + H2_effect + H4_effect) +  # Main effects
                          (H1xH2_synergy + H1xH4_synergy + H2xH4_synergy)  # Pairwise synergies

3-way_synergy = Observed - Predicted_from_pairwise
```

**4-Way Interaction:**
```
Observed = ON-ON-ON-ON (all four mechanisms active)

Predicted_from_lower_orders = OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF +
                               (H1 + H2 + H4 + H5) +  # Main effects (1st order)
                               (H1xH2 + H1xH4 + H1xH5 + H2xH4 + H2xH5 + H4xH5) +  # Pairwise (2nd order)
                               (H1xH2xH4 + H1xH2xH5 + H1xH4xH5 + H2xH4xH5)  # 3-way (3rd order)

4-way_synergy = Observed - Predicted_from_lower_orders
```

### Classification Criteria

**Emergent Synergy:**
- 3-way synergy > +10%: Cooperative amplification beyond pairwise prediction
- 3-way synergy < -10%: Destructive interference beyond pairwise prediction
- |3-way synergy| ≤ 10%: Pairwise model adequate (GENERALIZES)

**Complexity Threshold:**
- If 4-way synergy >> 3-way synergies: Qualitative shift at 4-mechanism combination
- If 4-way synergy ≈ 3-way synergies: Continuous scaling across orders
- If 4-way synergy ≈ 0: Lower-order models fully predictive (no emergence at highest order)

## Expected Results

### Generalization Scenarios

**Scenario A: Pairwise Models Generalize (ADDITIVE at higher orders)**
- 3-way synergies ≈ 0 (within ±10%)
- 4-way synergy ≈ 0
- **Implication:** Mechanisms can be tuned independently using pairwise characterization (Paper 3)
- **Optimization:** Simple - optimize each pair, combine linearly

**Scenario B: Emergent 3-Way Effects (NON-ADDITIVE at 3 mechanisms)**
- 3-way synergies significant (|synergy| > 10%)
- 4-way synergy ≈ sum of 3-way synergies
- **Implication:** Triplet interactions critical, but no further emergence at 4-way
- **Optimization:** Complex - must consider all triplets, but 4-way predictable from 3-way

**Scenario C: Qualitative Shift at 4-Way (EMERGENT COMPLEXITY)**
- 3-way synergies moderate
- 4-way synergy >> 3-way synergies (new phenomena at full combination)
- **Implication:** Holistic optimization required - cannot decompose into lower-order effects
- **Optimization:** Very complex - must test full 4-mechanism combination empirically

### Predictions

Based on NRM framework theory:

**H1×H2×H4 (Energy Pooling × Fragmentation × Throttling):**
- Prediction: **ANTAGONISTIC 3-way** - Pooling creates agents, fragmentation slows them, throttling limits creation → triple interference

**H1×H2×H5 (Energy Pooling × Fragmentation × Complexity):**
- Prediction: **MIXED 3-way** - Pooling + complexity synergistic, but fragmentation interferes → partial cancellation

**H1×H4×H5 (Energy Pooling × Throttling × Complexity):**
- Prediction: **ADDITIVE 3-way** - Throttling controls quantity, pooling + complexity enhance quality → orthogonal effects

**H2×H4×H5 (Fragmentation × Throttling × Complexity):**
- Prediction: **ANTAGONISTIC 3-way** - Fragmentation degrades memory needed for complexity, throttling limits recovery → compounding interference

**H1×H2×H4×H5 (All Four):**
- Prediction: **SCENARIO B** - 3-way effects present, but 4-way predictable from lower orders → no qualitative shift

## Notes

**Design Philosophy:**
This factorial extension follows the "complete characterization" principle: Start with pairwise (Paper 3), extend to 3-way and 4-way (Paper 4), achieve exhaustive mapping of all mechanism interdependencies. Enables answering: "Can we predict complex system behavior from simpler interactions?"

**Efficiency:**
Total experimental burden: 24 conditions (Paper 3 pairwise) + 56 conditions (Paper 4 higher-order) = 80 conditions. Deterministic paradigm (n=1) makes this tractable (~120-144h total). Factorial completeness justifies investment.

**Theoretical Significance:**
If higher-order synergies are minimal (Scenario A), validates reductionist approach - system behavior predictable from pairwise analysis. If significant emergence (Scenario C), demonstrates irreducible complexity requiring holistic modeling. Either outcome informs NRM framework development and multi-mechanism optimization strategies.
